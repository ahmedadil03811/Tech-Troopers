Pristina, 13 December 2004
Case 285/04
Pristina Airport – Possible administrative irregularity regarding tender procedures involving
Vendor 1 and Vendor 2
Allegation
Two companies with the same owner took part at least three times in the same Airport tenders.
Background Information
The Kosovo citizen, Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 Representative, is the owner and Director of the
Pristina-based Vendor 1 and also a 51% shareholder of the Pristina-Ljubljana-based company
Vendor 2. Both companies have their residences at the same address in Pristina.
Both Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 submitted three times in 2003 for the same tenders:
1. Supply and Mounting of Sonic System in the Fire Station Building. Winner was Vendor
2 with €1,530 followed by Vendor 1 with €1,620. The third company, Vendor 3, did not
provide a price offer.
2. Cabling of Flat Display Information System (FIDS). Winner was Vendor 1 with €15,919
followed by Vendor 2 with €19,248.70. The other two competitors, Vendor 3 and Vendor
4, offered prices of Euro 19,702 and Euro 21,045.
3. Purchase and fixing of Cramer Antenna. Winner was again Vendor 1 with €3,627.99
followed by Vendor 2 with €3,921. The other two competitors, Vendor 3 and Vendor 4,
offered prices of €4,278 and €4,670.
Investigative details
4. In his/her interviews conducted on 31st August and 14th September 2004, Vendor 1 and
Vendor 2 Representative admitted that the fact that both Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 took part
together in three Airport tenders put other competitors at a disadvantage, but alleged both
companies have never exchanged information with regard to the price offers.
1There were doubts whether both companies Vendor 3 and Vendor 4 exist and submitted bids for
the three tenders. The ITF investigation, with support from the Kosovo Organised Crime Bureau
(KOCB), has found no reference with regard to the existence of the alleged competitor Vendor 4
in Pristina. The alleged company Vendor 3 was found to be a supermarket located in Prizren.
The above-mentioned facts are already part of the ITF case no. 286/04 that was submitted to the
International Prosecutor, UNMIK Department of Justice, in October 2004. On 1 December 2004,
the ITF contacted the International Prosecutor for a legal assessment of this case. Although this
case would clearly be a breach of Economic Law, there is no applicable law in Kosovo for the
time being.
Conclusions
The entire matter has to be seen as an administrative irregularity. It is obvious that international
procurement rules and economic crime law had been breached but the Procurement Regulation
that was in force at that time – Financial Agreement 1999/2 – does not indicate cases like
described before and Kosovo does not have yet any Economic Law.
As agreed with the International Prosecutor, a copy of the Final Report will be provided for him
as background information related to the ITF case no. 286/04.
Recommendations
It is recommended that UNMIK, and in particular, the KTA undertake the following actions:
Recommendation 1: The Airport staff responsible for procurement activity should receive
adequate training in the handling of procurement matters and to adhere to all applicable
Procurement Regulations.
Recommendation 2: The Airport staff responsible for procurement activity has to ensure a fair
competition and pay more attention to check the background of the bidding companies.

Investigation Task Force
Irregularities in the procurement for the extension of the
Cargo Apron at Pristina Airport (Case 0282/04)
I. INTRODUCTION
1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28 February 2003 into the financial
statements of Pristina International Airport conducted by the Chartered
Accountants, which led to an investigation concerning alleged corruption and
irregularities arising in the course of procurements and contracts at Pristina
International Airport.
2. There are four specific allegations in this report of investigation:
• tender specifications produced by the Pristina Airport for the cargo apron
extension were insufficiently specific and without clear instructions for bidder
contrary to UNMIK Finance Regulation 1999/2;
• three persons on the bid opening committee were also part of the technical
evaluation committee contrary to procurement regulations;
• the contract for the cargo apron extension was not provided to the UNMIK
Office of the Legal Adviser for clearance; and
• it is alleged that the Vendor was allowed to certify its work as per the
requirements of the contract.
II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS
PROCEDURAL RULES
Section 1 of UNMIK Regulation 1999/24 dated 12 December 1999 as amended,
states that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:
a) “The regulations promulgated by the Special Representative of the
Secretary General (SRSG) and subsidiary instruments issued pursuant to
those regulations; and
b) The Law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.”
UN Staff Regulations 1.2 (b) stipulates, “Staff members shall uphold the highest
standards of efficiency, competence and integrity”
UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using
Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds provides that:
Article 4 1 – “Competition among and participation in the procurement process
shall be maximised.”2
Article 4.1.1 – “All Suppliers and Contractors and their tenders shall be treated
fairly, equally, and non-discriminatorily, without favouritism or prejudice and each
Tender shall be judged on its merits.”
Article 4.3.3. – “If a consultant or any principal, officer or employee of such
consultant has participated or will participate in any manner in the preparation of
the UNMIK Kosovo Interim Administration’s Tendering for a contract, including
but not limited to preparations of specifications or any other Tender Documents,
no such consultant nor any principal officer or employee of such consultant, no
“related person” nor any “illegal payer” may tender for or sponsor or participate in
the Tendering for such contract.”
Article 23.3 – “All tender documents shall contain complete information in neutral
and objective terms so that there can be full and fair competition among all
suppliers. In particular Tender Documents must include the advertisement and ..”
Article 23.3.4 – “…full technical specifications, including the time limits for
delivery and completion.”
Staff Rule 110.1: Misconduct. “Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her
obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and the
Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances, or to observe the standards of
conduct expected of an international civil servant, may amount to unsatisfactory
conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2, leading to the institution of
disciplinary measures for misconduct.”
III. METHODOLOGY
3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on
the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators
conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons
indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by
obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV,
which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.
IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
4. Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under
Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal
buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period
covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the
Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the
Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution
1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999.
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned
and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.
5. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina
Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,
including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised DOTI Official 1 (Department
of Transport and Infrastructure). The DOTI was later known as the Transport
Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left
UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an
international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations,3
reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001.
Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from the
armed forces of a United Nations member state, specifically Airport Engineer 1,
Airport Engineer 2, and Airport Engineer 3, and later by a consultant from the
Consulting Company.
6. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed
from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional
Manager was appointed. Under him were the PEAP Official and ATCS Official
(Air Traffic Control Services).
7. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been
under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under
ICAO regulations.
8. It is against this background of change that procurement procedures relating to
the following contract have been examined.
V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS
9. This part of the investigation relates to a tender for a contract for the extension of
the Cargo Terminal Apron at Pristina Airport. The value of the contract was
€774,318.63.
Allegation 1
(Specifically, the tender documents for the cargo apron did not comply with the
requirements of Article 23.4 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2
on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds, as they were
based on summary documents and did not include clear instructions on drawings
and plans.)
10. A note from the Project Engineer at the Evaluation Company to the PEAP
Official, dated 31 January 2001, indicates that the Evaluation Company was
commissioned to produce a preliminary design for the Cargo Terminal at Pristina
Airport. The design also provided for the construction of the Cargo Apron
Extension.
11. A prequalification evaluation was held 5 April 2001 as a result of which five
companies were pre-qualified to submit bids for the Cargo Apron Extension. Four
companies submitted bids, and following an evaluation, the contract was
awarded to the Vendor. A contract was signed for the Cargo Apron Extension on
11 September 2001.
12. A letter from the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP dated 9 May 2001 indicates that it
submitted a bid for the Cargo Apron Extension. The tender documents include
what appears to be a section from the preliminary design documents produced by
the Evaluation Company. Specifically, it includes a section entitled ”Bills of
Quantities” from pages 17 and 18 of the Evaluation Company preliminary design
documents.4
13. An interoffice memorandum providing an “outstanding issues update to Official
2”, from DOTI Official 3 to Staff member 1 at the office of Official 2 dated 18 May
2001, could give rise to the suggestion that offers were provided by companies
on 28 May 2001, and the Vendor had been chosen for the works in advance.
However, a more likely explanation is the date of the interoffice memorandum
has been incorrectly dated, since the document contains reference dates relating
to project “events” which post date 18 May 2001. At paragraph 2b, the interoffice
memorandum states that the Cargo Apron invitation to tender was based on
summary documents.
14. At paragraph 4 of the Cargo Apron Extension evaluation report dated 2 August
2001, the committee notes that the bidding documents did not include clear
instructions on drawing and plans. It therefore was recommended that
negotiations be held with the lowest bidder, the Vendor, on further details of the
scope of works.
15. In combination, the two documents suggest that the tender documents did not
comply with Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2
on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds.
16. When asked whether he/she was of the view that the tender documents complied
with the provisions of Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative
Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget
Funds, DOTI Official 2 conceded that if an engineer was asked this question,
he/she would indicate that the tender specifications were technically deficient and
did not comply with Article 23.3.
17. DOTI Official 2 explained that the technical details of the Cargo Apron extension
project were taken from the cargo terminal study produced by the Evaluation
Company and pasted into the tender document specifications. Thereafter, it was
up to the company winning the tender to demonstrate that they could fulfil the
specification.
18. According to DOTI Official 2, Airport Engineer 1, who arrived shortly after the
tender had been launched, had been angry with the Evaluation Company for
allowing DOTI Official 2 to send out excerpts of their study as the tender
specifications. Airport Engineer 1 had also expressed concern at the method
used for preparing the tender documents, as from an engineering point of view
the tenders did not contain sufficient detail. However, DOTI Official 2 stated that if
the Evaluation Company had been asked to prepare the tender documents, it
would have cost more money. He/she had therefore prepared the tender
documents himself/herself and sent them to a Procurement Official at the CPE to
review and help him with the procurement exercise.
19. Assistance from the CPE was provided primarily by a CPE Procurement Officer,
and to a lesser extent by the Procurement Official, as to the procurement
documents and rules. However, DOTI Official 2 expressed the view that neither
the Procurement Official nor the CPE Procurement Officer would have had the
technical expertise or time to review the technical specifications.5
20. DOTI Official 2 emphasised that there was no engineering expert to support
his/her work at the time the tender was launched, a fact that made his/her work
very difficult.
Allegations 2 & 3
(Specifically, three of the persons on the bid opening committee and evaluation
committees were the same parties who should not have carried out both tasks.)
and
(The contract for the Cargo Apron Extension was not channelled through the Office
of the Legal Adviser.)
21. The evaluation report dated 2 August 2001 is signed by three parties, who are
also listed as having attended the bid opening session. This indicates that the
composition of the bid opening committee and the evaluation committee
overlapped.
22. When asked about this issue in interview DOTI Official 2 confirmed that he/she
was both on the bid opening committee and was a member of the evaluation
committee. He/she added that the people who evaluated the offers signed the
evaluation report. This is in conflict with UN regulations, which segregate the two
roles. An interoffice memorandum dated 24 September 2001 indicates that the
contract for the Cargo Apron Extension had not been channelled through the
Office of the Legal Adviser.
Allegation 4
(Specifically, that the Vendor produced its own test results to confirm the quality of its
own work on the Cargo Apron, resulting in a conflict of interest.)
23. An interoffice memorandum from Staff member 2 to the Procurement Official,
signed by DOTI Official 1 dated 18 October 2001, indicates that DOTI Official 1
authorised the soil stabilisation work. The memorandum also adds that the work
was inadvertently not included in the original contract.
24. DOTI Official 2 told the ITF that in order to progress the cargo apron tender,
he/she had to organise a geographical survey. He/she added that only after the
tests were done could the tender go ahead. However, the evaluation report at
paragraph 4 suggests that information on the nature of the ground does not
appear to have been included in the tender documents. In addition, a letter from
the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP dated 27 June 2001, but apparently not
received at UNMIK and PEAP until 17 October 2001, according to a manuscript
note signed by Airport Engineer 1 at the bottom of the letter, suggests that it
carried out its own soil tests.
25. A letter from the Vendor to PEAP dated 18 September 2003 suggests that the
Vendor also produced its own bearing capacity report for the Cargo Apron,
thereby “self certifying” its own work. Whilst the tender documents at page 5,6
reference 11.4, provide for the Contractor to pay liquidated damages in the event
that the “load-bearing “ capacity of the apron is less than foreseen in the contract,
upon completion of the work, the contract is silent as to whom should carry out
the tests. However, it is questionable as to whether the Vendor should have
carried it out, since it presents a conflict of interest.
26. When asked about this in interview, the Divisional Manager stated:
“Without seeing any other documents, on the face of it, it does appear that there
could be a conflict of interest here. But the report was produced by a professional
pavement engineer, at a laboratory. Therefore, one can assume a certain degree
of integrity.”
27. The ITF notes that the PEAP Official indicated that he/she was unhappy about
the Vendor self-certifying its work and he/she commented that the airport
engineer should have questioned it.
28. The ITF does not have sufficient technical knowledge to assess the adequacy of
the Vendor’s work. However, a letter from the Divisional Manager to Staff
Member 3 dated 25 August 2002 gives rise to the possibility that it was not up to
specification in certain areas.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
29. Evidence indicates that the tender documents for the cargo apron did not comply
with the requirements of Article 23.4 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative
Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget
Funds, as they were based on summary documents and did not include clear
instructions on drawings and plans. This appears to have been due to an attempt
to cut costs in preparing the tender documents, as well as a lack of appropriately
qualified staff.
30. In mitigation, the inadequacy of the tender documents also appears to have been
due to ignorance as to the appropriate quantity of detail to be included in the
tender documents rather than a deliberate act calculated to manipulate the tender
process.
31. DOTI Official 2 is primarily responsible for the shortcomings in the tender
documents although, DOTI Official 1 and the CPE must also bear a certain
amount of responsibility.
32. The shortcomings in the tender documents are likely to have prejudiced some
companies in their decision as to submitting bids for the tenders, since they may
not have been clear as to the detailed requirements of the tender and therefore
submitted insufficient detail in their bids as a result.
33. Three persons are indicated to have both attended the bid opening session as
well as been on the tender evaluation committee, in conflict with UN regulations.
34. Evidence indicates the contract for the Cargo Apron Extension was not
channelled through the Office of the Legal Adviser.7
35. Evidence indicates that the Vendor produced its own bearing capacity report for
the Cargo Apron, thereby “self certifying” its own work and presenting a potential
conflict of interest.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
36. It is recommended that UNMIK ensure that all contracts are referred for legal
advice before signature in order to reduce potential liability issues and avoid a
recurrence of the problems of this instant case. (IV04/282/01)
37. It is recommended that UNMIK ensure that staff understand and comply with the
requirements of the UNMIK Public Procurement Regulation No 2004/3.
(IV04/282/02)
38. It is recommended that UNMIK ensures that all work conducted under contract, in
which the final product has to be evaluated, that said the evaluation be carried
out by a suitably qualified, independent entity. (IV04/282/03)
39. It is recommended that DPKO take appropriate action with respect to DOTI
Official 2 (currently serving with MONUC).

Description
This is a Secret US National Security Agency (NSA) report derived from intelligence intercepts of officials
within the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, shortly
before the official visit of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to Washington DC, for talks with President
George W Bush. Abe's government is reported to have been considering not informing the United States
of the Prime Minister's plan to reduce carbon emissions, on the basis that the plan might be opposed by
the Bush administration. As the report shows, the National Security Agency was aware both of the plan
not to inform the United States, and of the government's change of mind, which was taken at a briefing at
the Prime Minister's official residence.Japanese to State Goal of Reducing Carbon Emissions by Half by 2050
(S//SI//NF)
(S//NF) In preparing for the 26 to 27 April visit to Washington by
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the Japanese Ministry of Economy,
Trade, and Industry (METI) apparently wanted to come up with a simple
message regarding climate change with which the U.S. can agree.
Accordingly, METI has pushed three principles: technical development,
energy conservation and nuclear energy, and participation of all
countries in the future framework. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MFA) apparently wants Abe to mention at the bilateral summit
Japan's goal of reducing carbon emissions by half by 2050 as part of
the ""Abe initiative,"" which will be announced in late May. The MFA
was considering not informing the U.S. in advance of its intention,
because the ministry did not expect Washington to approve of such a
goal, based on the U.S. reaction to climate change issues so far. It
was apparently decided at a briefing at the Prime Minister's official
residence that Abe will clearly state the goal at the bilateral
summit, with advance notification to the United States. Japan
anticipates no major harm to the Japanese­U.S. relationship as a
result.

Description
This is a secret US National Security Agency (NSA) 2008 report derived from intelligence intercepts of
officials within the Japanese government. The report observes that Japanese officials remain resolute in
their commitment to the ""sectoral approach"" to reducing carbon emissions, despite reported criticism from
the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the European Union. The report relates speculation by
Japanese officials about receptivity to the Japanese position among European countries and businesses.Tokyo's Climate Change Officials to Continue Promoting Sectoral
Approach (TS//SI//NF)
(TS//SI//NF) Japanese climate change officials apparently plan to
continue promoting the sectoral approach despite criticism from the
International Energy Agency (IEA) and some European Union officials.
Fatih Birol, Chief Economist of the IEA, reportedly warned the
Japanese in mid­May that they are pushing too hard to promote the
sectoral approach and may be perceived as offering this approach as
the only option for reducing carbon emissions. He also cautioned that
the sectoral approach is not yet understood and that Tokyo must
clarify the concept and promote understanding and trust among the
nations concerned. Masakazu Toyoda of the Japanese Ministry of
Economy, Trade, and Industry expressed frustration at this criticism
then laid out three advantages of the sectoral approach: first, the
approach is designed to get China, India, and the U.S. on board;
second, this approach allows developed countries to avoid expending
unnecessary efforts to reduce carbon emissions in areas covered by
the sectoral approach; and third, the sectoral approach will, in
Toyoda's estimation, not result in any economic or industrial loss
for developed or developing nations. One Japanese official thinks
that it may be difficult for the Europeans to implement the sectoral
approach in sectors such as electricity, which is already subject to
the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). He suggested that the ultimate
solution is dependent upon the EU accepting a method of determining a
figure for total carbon emissions reductions that includes the
electricity sector. Toyoda claimed that businesses from several
sectors­­including steel, aluminum, cement, and petroleum­­are
threatening to cease their European operations if the ETS continues
as is.

Description
This is a Secret US National Security Agency (NSA) 2009 report derived from intelligence intercepts of
officials within the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The report indicates that the
National Security Agency knew of the options under consideration within the Ministry for how Japan
should seek to patch up bilateral relations with the US over a trade dispute concerning the import of US
cherries. Among the options being discussed were the use of back channels to share information with
Washington. The report indicates that the main Japanese incentive is the avoidance of politicization of the
trade issue in Washington.Japanese Strive to Avoid Damage to U.S. Relations Over Cherry Imports
(TS//SI//OC/NF)
(TS//SI//OC/NF) Officials in the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) appeared recently to be seeking ways
to prevent damage to relations with the U.S. over the ministry's
decision to delay the importation of U.S.­origin cherries, a decision
driven by Japanese politicians and growers. MAFF was alarmed by the
very strong reaction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Tokyo's
ruling that imports could not commence until the end of this month,
when a pilot program involving inspections in the U.S. Pacific
Northwest by a MAFF inspector is expected to be concluded
satisfactorily. One approach under consideration is to have the
ministry admit to Washington, through back channels, that the
decision had been the product of political pressure. Also, it was
recommended that the U.S. be notified that­­unlike in the beef
dispute­­imports could begin as soon as the result of on­site
inspection is confirmed, rather than after the inspector had returned
to Japan and more tests conducted. The principal fear among the
Japanese is that the issue will become similarly politicized,
possibly at senior levels, in Washington.

Investigation Task Force
Allegations of theft and corruption arising out of the collection of handling and
landing fees and de-icing costs for passenger aircraft using Pristina Airport.
(Case 0283/04)
I. INTRODUCTION
1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28 February 2003 into the financial
statements of Pristina International Airport conducted by the Chartered
Accountants which led to an investigation concerning alleged corruption and
irregularities arising in the course of procurements and contracts at Pristina
International Airport.
2. There are three specific allegations in this report of investigation:
• Employees overcharged commercial flights using Pristina Airport for handling and
landing fees and other services.
• Employees failed to account for the money paid to them in handling and landing
fees and other services.
• Employees requested and /or received corrupt payments in return for allocating
landing slots to airlines at the most convenient times.
II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS
PROCEDURAL RULES
Section 1 of UNMIK Regulation 1999/24 dated 12 December 1999 as amended,
states that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:
a) “The regulations promulgated by the Special Representative of the
Secretary General (SRSG) and subsidiary instruments issued pursuant to
those regulations; and
b) The Law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.”
UN Staff Regulations 1.2 (b) stipulates “Staff members shall uphold the highest
standards of efficiency, competence and integrity”
Staff Rule 110.1: Misconduct. “Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her
obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and the
Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances, or to observe the standards of
conduct expected of an international civil servant, may amount to unsatisfactory
conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2, leading to the institution of
disciplinary measures for misconduct.”2
III. METHODOLOGY
3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on
the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators
conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons
indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by
obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV,
which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.
4. This report details the findings resulting from these enquiries.
IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
5. Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under
Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal
buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period
covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the
Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the
Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution
1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999,
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned
and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.
6. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina
Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,
including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport
and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport
Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left
UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an
international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations,
reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001.
Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from the
armed forces of a United Nations member state, specifically Airport Engineer I,
Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3, and later by the Consultant from the
Consulting Firm.
7. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed
from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional
Manager was appointed at the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under him
were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official.
8. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been
under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under
ICAO regulations.
9. It is against this background of change that procurement procedures relating to
the following contract have been examined.3
V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS
10. This case concerns allegations of corruption by staff at Pristina Airport arising
from handling and landing fees levied on passenger aircraft using the Airport in
the period January – December 2001. The case also deals with allegations of
corruption arising from de-icing costs levied on passenger aircraft using the
Airport during the same period and alleged requests for corrupt payments for the
allocation of landing slots to airlines at the most convenient times.
11. Samples were taken from a total of 21 airlines using the airport at Pristina in
2001. The year 2001 was selected due to the fact that fees appear to have been
collected and receipts issued manually. Therefore, it was assessed that a greater
risk of fraudulent activity existed.
12. Where possible, similar dates and the type of aircraft were selected to allow for a
comparative analysis of landing charges and passenger charges.
13. An average price was then calculated for each type of aircraft by selecting a
sample of landings for each airline and multiplied by the number of flights to give
an estimate of the total income from landing fees.
14. The ITF obtained a price list, dated 1 January 2002, which provides an indication
as to the respective costs for basic airport services, based on the weight of the
aircraft.
Handling Fees and De-icing costs
15. The total income from landing fees in 2001 was estimated at DM 14,357,949
(equivalent to €7,341,163. This compares with a figure of €7,376,182 in the profit
and loss accounts produced by the Chartered Accountants.
16. This result suggests that in the absence of further information, the aircraft
charges agreed with the figures produced in the official accounts of the Airport.
However, the integrity of the information on which the accounts are based cannot
be verified. The possibility therefore remains that airlines were routinely
overcharged.
17. It was noted that there are small variations in the prices charged to different
airlines for the same type of aircraft. However, certain airlines appeared to have
measurably lower costs. These were:
• Airline 1 – Average DM 2190
• Airline 2 – Average DM 2888.
18. The receipts books do not indicate whether Airline 1 carried passengers and if so,
how many.
19. It was notable that where aircraft requested de-icing facilities, this appears to
have added considerably to the landing fees costs.
20. A schedule was created detailing costs associated with de-icing. With the
possible exception of one Airline 3 flight, this does not appear to indicate any4
obvious anomalies, although it again did not take into account the possibility that
airlines were uniformly being overcharged for de-icing.
Landing Fees
21. Passenger taxes appear to be charged at 25 DM per passenger. A spreadsheet
was created detailing the total number of persons travelling in the period 1
February 2001 until 31 December 2001 together with the number of persons not
paying passenger tax. The file did not contain any data for the month of January
2001.
22. The spreadsheet produced by the ITF indicated a total of 375,472 passengers
during the relevant period, of whom, 18,996 did not pay the required passenger
tax. If this number is multiplied by 25 DM and converted to Euro per paying
passenger, this gives a total of €4,799,395 as against a stated income figure in
the accounts of €4,919,190 for the whole year. This gap is diminished if a number
of passengers were to be added for the month of January 2001.
23. However, there remains a possibility that the passengers were not being charged
airport tax when they should have been, or that the sums detailed in the accounts
do not equate with sums actually paid.
24. In an effort to verify whether or not airlines were being routinely overcharged for
handling and landing fees or de-icing costs, the ITF sent a request to IATA to
provide information from Airline 3, Airline 4, Airline 5 and Airline 6 concerning any
instances of overcharging or extortion of money by staff at Pristina Airport. The
request also sought information concerning any instances of corruption arising
from the allocation of landing slots at Pristina Airport.
25. Regrettably, to date, no substantive response has been received from the airlines
or IATA.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
26. Whilst the figures for handling and landing fees broadly agree with the figures
produced in the accounts of the Airport, it is not possible to ascertain whether the
source of information forming the basis of the accounts is reliable.
27. In the absence of cooperation from the Airlines and IATA, despite repeated
requests by the ITF, it is not possible to progress the case further.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
28. It is therefore recommended that based on the results of this investigation,
UNMIK should prepare an official request to the above-mentioned airlines in an
effort to obtain their support and any information relevant to this matter.

110.pdf,"(TS//SI//NF) EU, Japan Study Ways to Respond to U.S. Tactics in Doha Round Talks
(TS//SI//NF) The EU and Japan were engaged as of early December in strategy sessions aimed
at a common handling policy to deal with potential U.S. moves in the Doha Round negotiations.
There was a conviction in both Brussels and Tokyo, according to Japanese reporting, that great
care must be taken to avoid falling prey to U.S. moves designed to extort concessions through
exaggerated initial demands. Regarding U.S. domestic supports for agriculture, for example,
Japanese Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Toshikatsu Matsuoka and EU
Agriculture Commissioner Marianne Fischer-Boel recently pondered whether to jump-start the
negotiations by asking the U.S. for a specific dollar figure in reduced supports. The problem for
the EU, it was noted, is whether or not the proposed $17 billion mark is an acceptable point of
departure, since U.S. supports at that level are judged to be in no way comparable to the
breadth of market access that Brussels put on the table last July. A figure of $14 to $15 billion
would be more in line with the EU's thinking, Fischer-Boel indicated. The EU also had concerns
that Washington may be headed for a showdown with developing countries over special
products. As for sensitive products, Fischer-Boel's deputy chef de cabinet, Klaus-Dieter
Borchardt, hinted to the Japanese that the EU may be willing to go lower than its current official
limit of 8 percent, possibly as low as 4 to 5 percent; however, that would be hard for Japan to
accept. Borchardt also tried to allay Japanese fears that the EU might try again to enter into a
bilateral, under-the-table deal with the U.S. (as had happened in Cancun in 2003), saying that
Brussels had learned its lesson with respect to such back-door actions.

palliatives and then to implement them in order to show that his government is serious about its
debt problem. Sarkozy was said to have told Berlusconi that while the latter's claims about the
solidity of the Italian banking system may be true in theory, financial institutions there could
soon ""pop"" like the cork in a champagne bottle, that ""words are no longer enough,"" and that
Berlusconi must now ""make decisions."" Also on the 24th, Valentini indicated that EU Council
President Herman Van Rompuy had urged Italy to undertake policies aimed at reducing the
impression within the EU that the country is weighed down with an enormous debt at a moment
in time when it also is struggling with low productivity and showing little dynamism. In Van
Rompuy's opinion, Spain is the model that Italy should now be seeking to emulate.

(TS//SI//OC/REL TO USA, FVEY) Israel has reached out to Europe, including Italy, for help in
smoothing out the current rift in its relations with the United States, according to Italian
diplomatic reporting of 13 March. Speaking with Italian Prime Minister (PM) Silvio Berlusconi,
Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu insisted that the trigger for the dispute--Israel's decision to build
1,600 homes in contested East Jerusalem--was totally in keeping with national policy dating
back to the administration of Golda Meir, and blamed this mishandling on a government official
with poor political sensitivity. The objective now, Netanyahu said, is to keep the Palestinians
from using this issue as a pretext to block a resumption of talks or to advance unrealistic claims
that could risk sinking the peace negotiations altogether. Continuing, he asserted that the
tension has only been heightened by the absence of direct contact between himself and the
U.S. President. In response, Berlusconi promised to put Italy at Israel's disposal in helping
mend the latter's ties with Washington. Other Israeli officials, meanwhile, believed that this tiff
goes far beyond merely the question of the construction plans, marking instead the lowest point
in U.S.-Israeli relations in memory.

(TS//SI//NF) Japan, preparing for its role as chairman of the Group-of-8 (G-8) summit at Lake
Toya early in July, has given notice that it intends to strive for a long-term commitment on
climate change with specific figures, while Germany believes that the crucial issue at the summit
is whether the U.S. will accept going beyond Heiligendamm (the site of last year's G-8 summit)
language in the framework of the G-8 if the emerging countries do not accept numerical targets
at the Major Economies Meeting (MEM). (According to press reports, leaders from 16 countries,
including the members of the G-8 plus China, India, Brazil, Australia, Indonesia, South Korea,
South Africa, and Mexico, plan to discuss climate change on the margins of the G-8 summit in
Japan.) Masaharu Kono, Japan's G-8 sherpa, emphasized Tokyo's position in an exchange with
his German counterpart, Bernd Pfaffenback, on 17 June, while Pfaffenback provided his
country's take on the issues to be addressed at Lake Toya. The German also noted that, in
response to a U.S. request, his country would likely give up its demand for a 25- to 45-percent
mid-term carbon dioxide reduction at the MEM. In addition, he does not believe that the
emerging economies are willing to go beyond the Bali language at present, his feeling being
that they prefer instead to wait until next year's G-8 summit in Copenhagen, because they do
not wish to give up things now that they might be prepared to give up later. It is also
Pfaffenback's position that a failure of the emerging economies to accept a long-term goal with
numbers, even in brackets, would pose difficulties for the G-8 and possibly lead to a clash at the
summit itself if there is no fallback position.

114.pdf,"UNSYG Stresses Importance of EU Leadership Role in Climate Change (TS//SI-G//OC/NF)
(TS//SI-G//OC/NF) UNSYG Ban Ki-moon, in an exchange on 10 December with German
Chancellor Angela Merkel, pointed out that the world would be watching the EU with ""keen
interest"" for reassurances that it will maintain its leadership role in combating climate change.
He believes that the mid-December EU Summit in Brussels will impact on the UN Conference
on Climate Change in Poznan as well as the 2009 Copenhagen Talks, stressing that without
positive signals and continued leadership from the EU, it would be difficult for the UN to make a
commitment in Poznan. Ban also maintained that since the new U.S. administration will have a
very engaging and proactive attitude on the issue, the time is right for the EU and the whole
world to create conditions necessary for reaching a meaningful deal at the 2009 UN Climate
Talks. In that regard, Ban considered the Poznan Conference to be very important as a ""bridge""
toward Copenhagen. Ban also praised Merkel for her personal efforts regarding the issue of
combating climate change and for encouraging other EU leaders to agree on the issue. For her
part, Merkel was optimistic that the EU Summit would come to an agreement, although she
acknowledged that the tough issue would involve carbon dioxide trading. Both Ban and Merkel
favored holding a mini-summit in early 2009 to involve the new U.S. administration, believing
that it is important to get a clear idea of U.S. intentions. Merkel believed that the climate-change
issue should be discussed at the heads-of-state level, otherwise it would not work.

INVESTIGATION TASK FORCE
Allegations of Bribes/Kickbacks for Employment
at Pristina Airport (Case No. 377/04)
I - Allegations
1. This report summarizes the investigation into a report supplied to the Investigation Task
Force (ITF) alleging that “kickbacks” had been paid to an airport official in order to obtain
employment at Pristina Airport. The allegations were contained in a confidential police
report written by Kosovo Police Service Officer 1 (KPS) serving in the Pristina Airport
Border Police, but originated from Non Staff member 1. The allegations specifically stated
that Non Staff member 1, and others, paid kickbacks to certain high-ranking Pristina Airport
employees in the hope of receiving employment.
II - Background
2. As this case was referred to the Department of Justice on 24 September 2004 and is
currently under two separate judicial investigations, the ITF did not continue with its
administrative investigations. This report summarizes the activities of the ITF. It should
also be noted that dissemination of this report should be severely restricted given the
ongoing criminal inquiries.
III - Investigative Details
3. A separate case - ITF Case No. 2l5/04 - relating to requests for sexual favours in return for
employment had already been under investigation when this report was received. Case No.
215-04 was subsequently closed due to the problem that none of the “victims"" were willing
to come forward and file an official statement on the matter. The reasons given to the ITF for
this fear of making a report was related to the threat of losing already obtained employment
at the airport, or to jeopardize marriages and reputations.
4. Non Staff member 1’s statements provided to the ITF Investigators, disclosed the following
two distinct cases:
Case A
5. On 25-26 July 2004, Non Staff member 1 alleges to have visited Official 1 (Pristina Airport)
asking how he/she could obtain employment at Pristina Airport. He/she stated that Official 1
1had replied that this was possible, but only via the payment of a considerable amount of
money.
6. Non Staff member 1 was aware that two other persons, Non Staff member 2 and Non Staff
member 3 had already paid €7,000.00 each, to Official 1 through the same procedure, in the
hope of receiving employment at Pristina Airport.
7. On either 30 or 31 July 2004, Non Staff member 1 said he/she was contacted by Official 1’s
daughter, Official 2’s Secretary, requesting him/her to come to Restaurant 1 located in
Hajvali.
8. Non Staff member 1 stated that he/she was personally greeted upon his arrival by Security
Official, Official 2’s Secretary and Official 1 and another person, male, but name unknown,
who was there seeking a similar employment route.
9. According to Non Staff member 1, the other person paid, in his presence, the sum of
€10.000,00 to Official 2’s Secretary, just before Non Staff member 1 himself/herself handed
€5.000,00 to the same person.
10. After both persons had paid the agreed upon cash amounts, they were both requested to sign
three different coloured books entitled “Airport Staff”, and then asked to leave because they
would be contacted by telephone as to the details of their future employment at Pristina
Airport.
11. Non Staff member 1 told the ITF that he/she was called again, two days later, in order to pay
an additional € 1.000,00, which he/she had then given to Official 2’s Secretary, in the
presence of his/her father, Official 1, during a dinner that Official 1 and his daughter were
having at the same mentioned restaurant. Non Staff member 1 also said that he/she paid
approximately € 180 for that night’s dinner and that he/she was called, always by Official 2’s
Secretary, to two further dinners at Restaurant 2 and at Restaurant 1. Non-Staff member 1
was requested to pay, amounts of € 225 and € 190 for the dinners. Non Staff member 1 stated
that during the dinner, the following Pristina Airport staff were present: Security Official, a
Secretary, Official 2, X-Ray Official, Official 1, Official 2’s Secretary, Official 3, Official 4
and one person who only spoke English (name unknown). This person may have been
Official 5, because Non Staff member 1 stated that this person was not a Kosovar, but an
International and furthermore, at a certain point when this person was not present, all the
others congratulated Non Staff member 1 for his new job. The Investigators believe that the
above-mentioned Airport staff were attempting to demonstrate to Non Staff member 1 that
they were in contact with the competent person who could authorize his employment.
Case-B
12. Non Staff member 1 stated that he/she was aware of another case of kickbacks for Pristina
Airport employment, which occurred circa 6 September 2004. Non Staff member 1, in his
role as the owner of a hamburger/sandwich stand/restaurant - well-frequented by airport
employees – said he/she was contacted by KPS officer 2 who requested information in
relation to what business connections Non Staff member 4 had within Pristina Airport.
213. Non Staff member 1 stated that Non Staff member 5, the wife of KPS Officer 2 met Non
Staff member 4 in the clothing boutique where he/she worked, while he/she was
purchasing airport uniforms. At that time, he/she had asked him/her how to obtain a job
at the airport. He/she allegedly replied he/she had no problems in getting him/her a job at
Pristina Airport due to his/her important airport contacts, but it would cost him/her €
3.000,00.
V – Conclusion
14. As ITF referred this case to the Department of Justice on 24 September 2004, no further
action was taken by ITF. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn at this stage on the basis of
ITF Investigations.
V - Recommendations
15. The ITF offers the following recommendations:
Recommendation No. 1: Due to the fact that this case has already been referred to the
International Prosecutor and is currently being investigated by the
Financial Investigation Unit, the ITF recommends that UNMIK
Pillar IV take no administrative action against Airport staff until
the/ judicial process is finalized (IV04/377/01);
Recommendation No. 2: Should the Airport staff not be criminally charged by the
Department of Justice, ITF recommends that UNMIK Pillar IV
should consider appropriate administrative action against
implicated Pristina Airport staff in the light of the Department of
Justice’s findings (IV04/377/02).

INVESTIGATION TASK FORCE
Investigation into Allegations of Bribery and Favouritism in Procurement of Uniforms
by Pristina Airport
(ITF Case No. 0462/04)
I. Background and Allegations
1. A Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) Internal Audit Unit (IAU) Internal Memorandum dated 4
October 2004, which described the audit of the procurement of staff uniforms by Pristina
Airport, raised concerns as to the reasoning for the cancellation of a competitive tender
for summer and winter uniforms (Pristina Airport Reference No. PEAP/CG/UAS/19/05/04)
and the subsequent issue of a single source contract for summer uniforms for new staff
(Pristina Airport Reference No. SHKTA/CG/16-04).
2. In the IAU memo, reference is made to a letter of complaint dated 28-06-04 from Vendor
1, a company that competed for the tender and that was subsequently awarded the single
source contract to supply summer uniforms. The author of the letter, Vendor 1 Manager,
alleged the existence of rumours and witnesses in the matter of the bribery of
Procurement Officer 1, Pristina Airport, and the Finance Officer, Pristina Airport, by one of
Vendor 1 Manager’s competitors in the tender process, Vendor 2. Vendor 1 Manager’s
letter also identified his intention to seek legal action against Procurement Officer 1 for
allegedly violating “the procurement rules” by: replacing a member of the Bid Evaluation
Committee in the competitive tender; allowing a member of the Finance Department, the
Finance Officer, to sit on the committee; and favouring Vendor 2 in the tender process.
3. During the course of the investigation, Procurement Officer 1 told the ITF that, following
the cancellation of the competitive tender, Vendor 1 Manager had made utterances to
him/her that Procurement Officer 1 had interpreted as a threat.
4. The ITF commenced an inquiry into the allegations regarding the procurement process
and now provides a summary of the case and its findings and recommendations.
II. Applicable Law
5. The law applicable to each of the allegations is detailed below.

Allegation 5: that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Officer 1
Provisional Criminal Code of Kosovo – Article 161 “Threat”
III. Investigation Details
6. Procurement Officer 1 managed the competitive tender for the supply of uniforms. In
addition to Vendor 1, Vendor 2 and Vendor 3 submitted bids following which Procurement
Officer 1 convened and chaired a Bid Opening Committee on 10-06-04. Present, in
addition to the committee that comprised members of the various airport work groups,
were representatives of the three bidding companies including Vendor 1 Manager.
7. Procurement Officer 1 also formed and chaired a Bid Evaluation Committee to assess the
offerings of the competitors, which comprised a range of uniforms and accessories for the
various categories of airport employees. On 18-06-04, the committee, though not satisfied
with all Vendor 2’s samples, tentatively decided in favour of that company, the median
bidder in terms of price (Vendor 1 was the highest bidder). The committee resolved that
Vendor 2 would be approached to determine the feasibility of no-cost design changes to
one of the uniforms for women employees. The committee reconvened on 23-06-04 at the
request of Pristina Airport Official. During the meeting, Pristina Airport Official announced
the cancellation of the tender. Pristina Airport Official later awarded a single-source
procurement contract for summer uniforms for newly hired staff, in the amount of
€106,059, to Vendor 1, which had supplied uniforms to the airport under two previous
contracts.
Allegation 1: that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer accepted bribes from Vendor
2
8. When asked by the ITF to substantiate his/her allegation that Procurement Officer 1 and
the Finance Officer had accepted bribes from Vendor 2, Vendor 1 Manager said that
he/she had heard the rumours in Pristina coffee bars but that he/she could not remember
from whom he/she had heard these rumours. He/she said that the witnesses to whom
he/she had referred in his letter of complaint were actually the same persons from whom
he/she heard the rumours. Vendor 1 Manager was unable to suggest which
representative of Vendor 2 had paid the bribes.
9. Vendor 2 Employee who attended the meeting of the Bid Opening Committee; Vendor 2
Manager; and Vendor 2 Director all told ITF that they had not paid bribes to Procurement
Officer 1 and/or the Finance Officer.
10. Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer both denied accepting bribes or any other
consideration from any person in this matter.
Allegation 2: that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of the Bid Evaluation Committee
11. Procurement Officer 1 explained to the ITF that the original nominee to the committee,
Committee member 1, had not been at work on the day that the committee first convened
and, therefore, had been replaced by Committee member 2, who then attended the
second session for continuity purposes. Committee member 1 and Committee member 2
confirmed Procurement Officer 1’s explanation for the replacement.
2Allegation 3: that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately included the Finance Officer in the Bid
Evaluation Committee
12. The Finance Officer, Procurement Officer 1 and Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that
the Finance Officer participated on the Bid Evaluation Committee. However, Procurement
Officer 1 and Pristina Airport Official each said that the other had nominated the Finance
Officer to the committee. KTA legal staff advised the ITF that the wisdom of allowing a
representative of the Finance Department to participate in bid evaluations is questionable
because, generally, officers whose function involves payment should not evaluate
contractors to whom payment will become due. According to KTA legal staff, however,
such participation is not precluded by any rule or law. Section 23.9.2 of Finance
Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revised 15 December 1999) – Public Procurement
Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds precludes only an “approving officer” from the
Procuring Entity who will eventually sign a contract from serving as a tender evaluator.
The Finance Officer was not an “approving officer” in this procurement process and,
therefore, was not prevented from serving as an evaluator.
Allegation 4: that Procurement Officer 1 favoured Vendor 2 in the tender process
13. In addition to Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer, Bid Evaluation Committee
members Committee member 3, Committee member 4, Committee member 5,
Committee member 6, Committee member 2, and Committee member 7 told the ITF that
the conduct of the committee was completely fair and proper. (Committee member 4 told
the ITF that he/she attended the first session of the Bid Evaluation Committee but that
he/she missed the second session because of the illness of his son.) The general
consensus of the committee was that Vendor 2’s samples were better overall in terms of
quality and design but the committee was not completely satisfied with Vendor 2’s goods.
However, Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that the committee was divided during the
second session, with one group preferring Vendor 2’s goods and the other preferring
those of Vendor 1. Pristina Airport Official said that Procurement Officer 1 (who, as
committee chair, did not have the right to vote) and the Finance Officer argued in favour
of Vendor 2. None of the committee members supported Pristina Airport Official’s
assertions in this regard.
14. The ITF allowed Pristina Airport Official to review a copy of the Bid Evaluation Committee
report prepared by Procurement Officer 1, the last page of which listed the attendees at
the session of the Bid Opening Committee (Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance
Officer were the only members of the Bid Opening Committee who also served on the Bid
Evaluation Committee). Upon looking at the attendee list of the Bid Opening Committee,
Pristina Airport Official named the committee members who, he/she said, had Vendor 1’s
and Vendor 2’s samples respectively. He/she correctly identified Procurement Officer 1
and the Finance Officer but the other four persons whom he/she named were members of
the Bid Opening Committee, not the Bid Evaluation Committee. Pristina Airport Official’s
mistaken identification of these persons as Bid Evaluation Committee members indicates
that his memory of the events of the second committee meeting might be unclear.
15. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that he/she believed that had he/she not cancelled the
competitive tender, the Bid Evaluation Committee would have awarded the contract to
Vendor 2. Pristina Airport Official said that he/she believed that Procurement Officer 1
had been “primed” to award the contract to Vendor 2 because Procurement Officer 1 had
expressed a preference for and argued in support of Vendor 2’s” inferior product and
because a source (whose identity Pristina Airport Official was unable to recall) had told
him/her that Procurement Officer 1 had been driven to the airport on several occasions by
a person in either the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of Transportation who was
associated with Vendor 2. Pristina Airport Official said that he/she cancelled the
competitive tender for these reasons. He/she said that he/she did not voice his suspicions
during the committee meeting, adding that he/she did not subsequently report his
suspicions because “priming” is common and if he/she reported every instance he/she
would not have time to do his job. He/she said that proving that Procurement Officer 1
had “pushed” one competitor would have been difficult.
16. Procurement Officer 1 told the ITF that a former Kosovo Minister is his godfather. He/she
said that he/she has never received a ride to the airport from the Former Kosovo Minister
3or in his car. He/she said that he/she has no idea whether the Former Kosovo Minister is
in any way associated with Vendor 2. He/she said that neither the Former Kosovo
Minister nor any other person pressured him/her to show favouritism to Vendor 2.
17. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that he/she had not seen Vendor 1 Manager’s letter of
complaint and had never heard of Vendor 1 Manager’s allegation regarding the bribery of
Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer. However, Pristina Airport Official’s
administrative assistant said that he/she had been present when Vendor 1 Manager
voiced his suspicion to Pristina Airport Official that an individual from the airport had
accepted bribes. Pristina Airport Official’ administrative assistant said that he/she could
not recall to whom Vendor 1 Manager referred. In addition, he/she told the ITF that
Vendor 1 Manager had given him/her his letter of complaint. Pristina Airport Official’s
administrative assistant said that he/she does not recall whether he/she handed the letter
to Pristina Airport Official or left it for his attention and he/she does not recall Pristina
Airport Official mentioning the letter.
18. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that, following the cancellation of the competitive
tender, his only alternative to obtain uniforms for newly hired staff was to award a contract
to Vendor 1, who had supplied the airport for the past two years. He/she said that had
he/she let a new tender for summer uniforms, the uniforms would not have been ready
until the end of August (2004).
19. ITF allowed Pristina Airport Official to read a copy of a memo dated 30-06-04 to him/her
from Procurement Officer 1 that described the events of the tender process and
summarized the reasons for its cancellation. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that,
although he/she had signed the memo, he/she had not “really read” it previously. The
articulated reasons for the cancellation are listed below. Pristina Airport Official and
Procurement Officer 1 said that they had contributed to the list of reasons but disagreed
over which of the reasons had been provided by whom, however, they both said that
Pristina Airport Official had provided the term “unsatisfactory quality”.
i) unsatisfactory quality
ii) unsatisfactory design
iii) evaluation committee not satisfied with the uniforms
iv) no manufacturing details were given
v) documents not completed
20. Procurement Officer 2 told the ITF that he/she transmitted several documents regarding
the single-source procurement of summer uniforms to KTA. Included in the document
package was a Procurement Memo dated 07-07-04 signed by Pristina Airport Official and,
according to Procurement Officer 2, prepared by Pristina Airport Official. (Pristina Airport
Official told the ITF that he/she believes that he/she wrote the justification.) The
justification segment of the memo stated that uniforms would be obtained by single-
source procurement from the current supplier (Vendor 1) for reasons of good quality and
durability.
21. The ITF pointed out to Pristina Airport Official that he/she had referred to the same
uniforms as being of “unsatisfactory quality” and “good quality” in the respective
documents. He/she then admitted “flowering up” his memo and providing embellishment
to ensure that KTA would approve the procurement. He/she said that the term
“unsatisfactory quality” in the memo dated 30-06-04 was poorly chosen and that the
quality of Vendor 1’s uniforms actually met the airport’s requirements. However, he/she
said that the design of the uniforms design was “basic and poor.”
Allegation 5: that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Officer 1
22. Procurement Officer 1 told the ITF that, on a day (he/she could not specify the date)
following the second meeting of the Bid Evaluation Committee at which the decision was
taken to cancel the competitive tender, Vendor 1 Manager entered Procurement Officer
1’s office and, in the presence of Procurement Officer 2 and a Pristina Airport Civil
Engineer made utterances that Procurement Officer 1 interpreted as a threat. According
to Procurement Officer 1, Vendor 1 Manager said that he/she would meet Procurement
Officer 1 outside; that, because he/she had cancelled the tender, Procurement Officer 1
4would find out who Vendor 1 Manager was; and that Procurement Officer 1 would see
what he/she had done by canceling the tender.
23. Procurement Officer 2 assistant confirmed that he/she had been present during the
incident but he/she had paid only partial attention to what transpired. He/She said that
Vendor 1 Manager might have mentioned that Procurement Officer 1 would have to deal
with KTA Internal Audit and the Investigation Task Force. The Civil Engineer also
confirmed his presence and said that he/she could recall Vendor 1 Manager saying
something to the effect of “You have to see who I am.” The Civil Engineer said that
he/she interpreted the words to mean that Procurement Officer 1 should be afraid of
Vendor 1 Manager.
24. Vendor 1 Manager confirmed that an incident had occurred between him/her and
Procurement Officer 1. Vendor 1 Manager said that he/she told Procurement Officer 1
that he/she was the main reason for the cancellation of the tender and that he/she told
Procurement Officer 1 “You’ll see what you have done. You’ll see that I’ll go to the highest
levels and if necessary, I’ll see you in court.” Vendor 1 Manager said that he/she did not
ask Procurement Officer 1 to go outside with him/her, that he/she did not threaten
Procurement Officer 1 and did not imply that he/she would commit physical aggression.
IV. Findings of Fact
Allegation 1: that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer accepted bribes from Vendor
2
25. The ITF did not find any evidence to support the allegation that Procurement Officer 1
and/or the Finance Officer accepted bribes from Vendor 2 in this matter. Moreover, the
ITF did not find evidence that any person received a bribe or other compensation or a
promise of a bribe or other compensation in relation to either the competitive tender or the
single-source procurement. Therefore, the allegation of bribery is considered to be
unsubstantiated.
Allegation 2: that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of the Bid Evaluation Committee
26. The rationale for replacing the member of the Bid Evaluation Committee is reasonable.
Furthermore, Vendor 1 Manager did not intimate that the replacement was made for any
questionable purpose. Therefore, the allegation is considered to be correct but the
substantive act is not considered to have been based on ulterior motives.
Allegation 3: that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately placed the Finance Officer on the Bid
Evaluation Committee
27. The ITF established that the Finance Officer participated on the committee but did not
determine whether he/she was nominated by Procurement Officer 1 or Pristina Airport
Official. Regardless, the ITF did not identify any indication that The Finance Officer’s
behaviour on the committee was in any way unprofessional or improper. In the absence
of specific regulations precluding the participation of finance personnel in such processes,
this allegation is considered to be unsubstantiated.
Allegation 4: that Procurement Officer 1 favoured Vendor 2 in the tender process
28. The ITF did not find any evidence to support the allegation that Procurement Officer 1 had
favoured Vendor 2 during the tender process. Similarly, Pristina Airport Official’s opinion
that Procurement Officer 1 had been “primed” to select Vendor 2 is unsubstantiated. The
credibility of Pristina Airport Official’s portrayal of Procurement Officer 1 as a strong
proponent of Vendor 2 in a divided committee was contradicted by the committee
members themselves and undermined by Pristina Airport Official’s misidentification of
most of the members. Procurement Officer 1’s management of the proceedings appears
to have been fair and objective based on the assertions of the members of the Bid
Evaluation Committee. Therefore, this allegation is considered to be unsubstantiated.
Allegation 5: that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Officer 1
529. The ITF was unable to substantiate that Vendor 1 Manager’s utterances constituted a
threat against Procurement Officer 1.
V. Recommendations
30. The ITF offers the following recommendations:
Recommendation No. 1: It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV inform Procurement Officer 1
and the Finance Officer, as well as the KTA Internal Audit Unit, that the ITF did not find any
wrongdoing on the part of Procurement Officer 1 or the Finance Officer. (IV04/462/01)
Recommendation No. 2: It is recommended that UNMIK provide this report to both the
Department of Justice and the Financial Investigation Unit for information purposes, so as to
assist current investigations related to the alleged payment of “kickbacks” in exchange for
employment at Pristina Airport. (IV04/462/02)

From: Wolfgang Nikolaus
De: Team Leader, Investigation Task Force, UNMIK
Subject: Alleged Fraud – Pristina Airport Cargo Department (ITF Case № 0261/04)
Object:
Allegation
1. In July 2004, the Investigation Task Force (ITF) was provided with a copy of a letter dated 28
May 2004, from the Cargo Manager of an Airline to a Staff Member of Public Enterprise
Airport Pristina. In the letter, the Cargo Manager referred to several problems relative to an
Invoice for April 2004 issued by the Cargo Department of Pristina Airport for the handling of
the outgoing mail of a Member State’s KFOR. At the time, Pristina Airport staff could not
locate a record of this invoice in the airport’s financial records, and, therefore, the commission
of fraud on the part of staff in the Cargo Department was suspected.
Background
2. Pristina Airport is the Airline’s cargo handling agent for both imports and exports and the
Airline is the Member State’s KFOR’s mail handling agent. Pristina Airport collects mail-
handling revenues on behalf of the Airline and deposits these revenues to the airline’s bank
account after deducting the appropriate commission.
3. The issues identified in the letter by the Airline Cargo Manager related to the high rate
(€0.50/kg) charged by Pristina Airport for handling outgoing mail; the fact that the Invoice had
been incorrectly sent to the Member State’s KFOR instead of their agent, the Airline; and the
inappropriate addition of Value Added Tax (VAT), which is not applicable to international
traffic.
Investigative Details
4. Subsequent to the receipt of the complaint, ITF learned from the Airline Cargo Dept. that
Pristina Airport had retroactively reduced its handling charges for outgoing mail to €0.12/kg
and was no longer charging VAT. Pristina Airport staff confirmed this information and advised
that the Invoice had been corrected and re-issued to the Airline. Furthermore, Pristina Airport
staff advised that correct records of all financial transactions between Pristina Airport and the
Airline relating to the invoices for April and subsequent months had been located. These
assertions were confirmed in copies of corrected invoices and excerpts of the electronic
financial records of Pristina Airport that were provided to ITF.
5. ITF made the general observation that Pristina Airport’s mail handling invoices indicate that
the entire invoiced amount is a “tax payment”. This terminology, according to Pristina Airport
staff, is incorrect as these amounts are handling fees that conform to established tariff rates.Conclusion and Recommendation
6. ITF was not able to establish an explanation for the difficulty in locating a record of the
transaction relating to the referred Invoice . The entry may have been overlooked or merely
delayed because of the misdirection of the April 2004 invoice. The ancillary issues of the
disputed mail handling rate and the application of VAT were resolved by mutual agreement.
7. ITF, by this memorandum, advises you that evidence of fraud, loss or wrongdoing was not
identified in this matter and, therefore, that no further action is required.
8. ITF recommends that steps be taken to replace the potentially misleading words “tax
payment” with appropriate terminology on Pristina Airport’s mail handling invoices.
9. Any questions or comments regarding the information provided in this report should be made

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
ID CASE NO. 0374/04
28 February 2005INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGED IRREGULARITIES IN THE PROCUREMENT OF
PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS (Case 0374/04)
I. BACKGROUND
1. The Investigations Division of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (ID/OIOS)
received information relating to problems in a procurement exercise for the purchase of Personal
Digital Assistants (PDA) undertaken in April 2004 by UNMIK’s Directorate of Rural Affairs
(DRA), Kosovo. A letter of complaint from one of the bidders alleged possible irregularities in
the bid evaluation and selection process.
2. An internal Pillar II review by the Policy Review and Internal Oversight Unit (PRIO)
highlighted possible irregularities in its preliminary report on the procurement exercise with a
recommendation for further investigation. This report was provided to ID/OIOS with a request
for further investigation. Based on the issues raised in the complaint and subsequently in the
PRIO Unit’s preliminary report, ID/OIOS investigated the entire tender process to determine
whether any violations of UN rules had occurred.
3. The Directorate of Rural Affairs (DRA) is located within UNMIK Civil Administration
(Pillar II); it was formed in October 2001 out of the former Department of Agriculture in the
Joint Administrative Interim Structure. The DRA comprises Veterinary Services & Veterinary
Border Control, Phytosanitary Border Control and Public Forests. The DRA remains a reserved
area under Security Council Resolution 1244 and the staff are United Nations staff members
subject to the UN Rules and Regulations. Also, the DRA undertakes its own procurement for all
of the divisions within the DRA.
II. INVESTIGATION DETAILS
4. ID/OIOS Investigators conducted interviews of all witnesses relevant to this matter,
including detailed interviews of the alleged subjects; collected documents and records
concerning the procurement, including all the bids submitted and the bid evaluation documents:
and analyzed the evidence.
5. The ID/OIOS investigation also reviewed the project funded by the European Agency for
Reconstruction (EAR) called “Strengthening of Public Veterinary Services in Kosovo”
(SPUVESEK), which identified the need for Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) to undertake the
task of Identification & Registration (I & R) of animals in Kosovo. The intent was to provide
veterinarians in the field with electronic devices to record all movements of animals in Kosovo.
6. In late 2002, the EAR consultant prepared the technical specifications for the PDAs based
on the proposal in SPUVESEK’s inception report of August 2002. Based on these specifications,
the DRA launched an initial tender in November 2003 for the PDAs, inclusive of both hardware
and software. All bids submitted exceeded the amount set aside for the purchase of the PDAs
(€170,000), therefore that tender was cancelled in February 2004 based on advice from the
Central Procurement Entity (CPE).
` 17. A second tender for the purchase of the required PDAs was then launched in April 2004,
using the same technical specifications. For the second tender, the DRA provided the bidders
with a price ceiling of €135,000 and requested that they state the number of devices in total that
the company could offer within the price ceiling. On 19 May 2004, the deadline for the
submission of bids, the DRA had received eight bids. As required, the bids were opened and
certified by members of a bid-opening panel consisting of DRA logistics officer 1, a DRA
procurement officer, DRA employee 1 and a DRA finance officer. The complainant told
ID/OIOS that the bid opening process occurred without incident and in accordance with correct
procedural requirements.
8. In the preliminary PRIO report, the price estimates as stated in the EAR consultant’s
inception report showed five different PDA models with integrated scanner capabilities. The
prices of the PDA models shown ranged from USD $323.38 to USD $818.30. ID/OIOS
adduced that the initial estimates were of regular PDAs, not the more rugged PDAs specified
in the technical specifications and required for use by veterinarians working in inclement
weather conditions. ID/OIOS also found that the estimates were obtained from the Internet for
the inception report and did not include the features that would make it technically appropriate
for the veterinarians in the field. The actual technical specifications prepared by the EAR
consultant later envisaged a more rugged, durable product that would be water, dust and drop
resistant. The price per unit of “rugged” PDAs, as required by the technical specifications, is
higher than the initial estimate made in the inception report. ID/OIOS verified this through
Internet research.
9. The complainant raised two main issues: firstly, that the bid submitted by Vendor 1, was
the lowest bid because it offered the most number of devices within the ceiling price. Secondly,
although two other bidders offered the same product as the winning bidder, but at a lower price,
they had not been selected. The PRIO preliminary report also identified these issues. ID/OIOS
Investigators reviewed all eight bids submitted and noted that DRA logistics officer 1 had
disqualified two, Vendor 2 and Vendor 3, because neither the Vendor 2 nor the Vendor 3 bid was
substantially responsive in that the total price of the product offered exceeded the price ceiling of
€135,000. During his/her pre-qualification of bids, DRA logistics officer 1 noted that Vendor 2
did not include taxes “CIP” Pristina Kosovo as required in the bid document, meaning the total
price would exceed the ceiling of €135,000 by more than €17,000; and Vendor 3’s total offer did
not include its yearly €16,500 maintenance surcharge fee, causing its bid to exceed the stated
price ceiling by more than €15,000.
10. In order to find out why the lowest bidder, Vendor 1, was still not selected, ID/OIOS
spoke separately with two members of the bid evaluation panel who explained the evaluation
process and why the panel recommended the selected bidder, Vendor 4. ID/OIOS was told that
the evaluation panel examined the bid documents submitted by the six pre-qualified bidders and
made comments and annotations on the table provided to them by the DRA logistics officer. The
evaluation panel relied heavily on the technical expertise of one panel member, DRA logistics
officer 2, who was responsible for the evaluation of the technical features of the PDAs offered.
DRA logistics officer 2 told ID/OIOS that his/her handwritten entries on the table were based
on the discussions of the entire evaluation panel, but that he/she independently verified that the
product offered by each bidder did possess the declared features and that he/she checked the
` 2technical data submitted by the individual bidders with the product datasheet and brochures
included in the bidding documents.
11. In terms of the priority selection criteria of the evaluation panel, DRA logistics officer 2
stated that the DRA had advised them to monitor not only the technical specifications but to
focus particularly on Section VII of the Bidding Documents “Obligatory Requirements to be
fulfilled by the bidders.” DRA logistics officer 2 highlighted the criteria of after-warranty
repair service located within Kosovo and repair or replacement within five working days
(based on the existing regulations in Kosovo as to notification, registration and recording of
information concerning movement of animals within five days of the movement). Therefore, if
a PDA device used for the communication of such data broke down and was not replaced
within a week, farmers and veterinarians would run the risk of not complying with the law.
12. ID/OIOS requested DRA logistics officer 2 to review each individual bid and to
explain his/her
13. annotations. DRA logistics officer 2 pointed out that Vendor 4, Vendor 5 and
Vendor 6 had offered virtually the same technical device. He/she found out that the
“Gotive H41 IB” model offered by Vendor 6 did not substantially differ from the
“Gotive H41” model offered by Vendor 4 and Vendor 5. DRA logistics officer 2
stated that the “Gotive H41” model complied with all the requirements laid out in
the technical specifications and pointed out that this device was very well protected
against environmental impact, notably in the field.
13. According to DRA logistics officer 2, the PDA model offered by Vendor 1 was not a
rugged PDA; it did not comply with the IP54 protection standards essential for outdoor use.
At first glance, Vendor 1 appeared to be the lowest bidder, because they offered the largest
number of PDAs for the stated price ceiling. However, the product did not comply with the
technical specifications and hence would be inappropriate for use by KVS veterinarians. As
such, the members of the evaluation panel did not short-list Vendor 1 for further examination.
14. However, the complainant contended that the PDA model offered by Vendor 1 did match
the technical specifications sought by the DRA and referred ID/OIOS to “Vendor 1’s”
handwritten responses to Section VI “Technical Specifications” of the Bidding documents. These
handwritten responses simply mark “Y” for yes and “N” for No as to whether the product
conformed to the technical specifications. The handwritten version shows a “Y” in the column
next to the technical requirement of environmental sealing. Investigators noted that the annex
submitted by the complainant is different from the typed page of the Vendor 1 response to
Section VI found in all three sets of bid documents submitted to the DRA at the bid opening.
The typed page clearly indicates that the product does not contain the required dust and weather
resistance feature required.
15. ID/OIOS learned that Vendor 1 did not retain a copy of the completed bid documents
submitted to the DRA as they had only prepared three sets, all of which were submitted to the
DRA on 19 May. The complainant seemed unaware of the discrepancy between the two
versions. ID/OIOS verified that the PDA model offered by Vendor 1 (EIA PD264-XB) does not
` 3contain the IP54 feature that would ensure environmental sealing against dust and rain. It did
appear from the complainant’s statements to ID/OIOS that Vendor 1 did not fully understand the
bidding document requirements and thus failed to offer a technically compliant product that
would be appropriate for outdoor use by Kosovo veterinarians.
16. ID/OIOS also addressed the issue of why Vendor 4 was selected even though two other
bidders offered the same model PDA at a lower price. Based on the technical specifications, the
evaluation panel narrowed the choices to three bidders whose product was technically compliant
with the specifications. Two panel members told ID/OIOS that among the three short-listed
bidders, the Vendor 4 offer seemed to be slightly more expensive than that of Vendor 5 and
Vendor 6. A more thorough review indicated that both Vendor 5 and Vendor 6 did not include
VAT in their offers; therefore, the total bid by these two vendors did not offer the best value.
In addition, neither Vendor 5 nor Vendor 6 offered servicing and repair of the PDAs in Kosovo
and the required five days turnaround time to replace a faulty device. Only the selected bidder,
Vendor 4, offered these two features along with a training component for the price submitted.
Given the fact that approximately 70 veterinarians were to be equipped with these PDAs, the
training component, although not included in the obligatory requirements, seemed to be a
valuable addition to the evaluation panel members. In the end, the evaluation panel members
selected Vendor 4 over the two other short-listed bidders because that bid included training as
part of the total package thereby offering the best value within the stated price ceiling for
DRA-KVS.
III. FINDINGS
17. ID/OIOS finds that the DRA finally procured PDAs from Vendor 4 based on the fact
that the product offered was in compliance with the technical specifications and met the
requirements of the bid specifications. The lower price estimates quoted in the inception report
related to standard office use PDAs as opposed to rugged, environmentally sealed PDAs that
would be suitable for outdoor use.
18. ID/OIOS also finds that the evaluation panel selected Vendor 4 because it was the only
bidder that complied with all technical specifications as well as the obligatory requirements in
Section VII of the bid documents such as the 12 months warranty for servicing and repair in
Kosovo and the five days turnaround time. In addition, it offered the best value by including a
training component in their offer.
19. The evidence adduced by the investigation further confirms that the PDAs offered by
Vendor 1 did not conform to the technical specifications of the ITB. Although the complainant
offered the largest number of PDAs within the stated ceiling price, the PDAs offered were not
appropriate for the designated use as set forth in the bid documents.
20. ID/OIOS determined that the procurement exercise was conducted in accordance with the
UN Financial Rules and Regulations governing procurement and with UNMIK’s Finance
Administrative Instruction 2/1999 on public procurements using KCB funds.
` 4IV. RECOMMENDATION
21. Based on the above, ID/OIOS makes the following the recommendation:
Recommendation 1: It is recommended that UNMIK take note of ID/OIOS’ findings and
conclusions and advise DRA staff members, DRA employee 2 and DRA logistics officer 1 of the
result of this investigation. (ID Rec. IV04/374/01)

Case 0049/04
I. INTRODUCTION
1. The Investigation Task Force (ITF) Kosovo, conducted an investigation into
the circumstances surrounding frequent cash withdrawals made from the bank
account of Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS), Prishtina International Airport. This
investigation was triggered by a forensic audit report of Public Enterprise Airport
Prishtina (PEAP) and ATCS that was released in February 2003 by the Chartered
Accountants. The activities of the Prishtina Airport fall under the control of the
Kosovo Trust Agency and UNMIK Pillar IV, which is administered by the European
Union. Investigations into allegations of fraud and corruption involving UNMIK, its
pillars and other organizational structures as well as the Provisional Institutions of
Self-Government (PISG) and independent bodies and offices established pursuant to
the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government in Kosovo fall
within the purview of ITF as laid out by the Executive Decision on the Establishment
of the Investigation Task Force UNMIK/ED/2003/16, dated 21 October 2003.
II. APPLICABLE LAWS
2. Pursuant to the authority given to The Special Representative of the
Secretary-General, under United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) of
10 June 1999, taking into account United Nations Interim Administration Mission in
Kosovo (UNMIK) Regulation No. 1999/1 of 25 July 1999 on the Authority of the
Interim Administration in Kosovo, for the purpose of defining the law applicable in
Kosovo, the SRSG promulgated that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:
a) The regulations promulgated by the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General and subsidiary instruments issued there under; and
1 of 12b) The law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.
3. With regards to performance and conduct of the employees of KTA, the
following UNMIK Regulation shall apply:
UNMIK Regulation No. 2001/27, Dated 8 October 2001- On Essential Labour
Law In Kosovo - Section 11- Termination of a Labour Contract, states the
following (extract):
11.3. Serious misconduct shall include the following:
(a) unjustified refusal to perform the obligations set out in the labour contract;
(b) theft, destruction, damage or unauthorized use of the employer’s assets;
(c) disclosure of business secrets;
(d) consumption of drugs or alcohol at work; and
(e) behavior of such a serious nature that it would be unreasonable to expect
the employment relationship to continue.
11.4. Unsatisfactory performance shall include the following:
(a) unjustified absence from work; and
(b) repeated mistakes not sufficient in themselves to justify a dismissal, but
which given their frequency and seriousness disrupt the normal course of the
employment relationship.
III. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
4. A review of the airport’s bank accounts and documents related to airport
operations, contracts, and financial matters revealed a number of cash withdrawals
from the ATCS bank account, many of them in €10.000 increments. Between July
2002 and November 2003, an amount of €642.000 was withdrawn in cash. The
majority of the withdrawals were identified as being for air travel and related
expenses for the then the ATCS Official; similarly for other ATCS employees; and
also for the so-called ‘petty cash’ purposes. The forensic audit report of February
2003 highlighted that the ATCS Official travelled frequently and questioned whether
the trips were necessary, or were approved.
5. It was established that on 01 July 2002, the new Division Manager, Airport
Sector UNMIK Pillar 4 was appointed with overall responsibility for Prishtina
Airport. The ATCS Official was in charge of the Department, which included day-
to-day management of the ATCS Finance Office. Finance Officer 1 and Finance
Officer 2 were employed as ATCS Finance Officers, both of them directly supervised
by the ATCS Official. It should be also mentioned that the ATCS Official, Finance
2 of 12Officer 1 and Finance Officer 2 were working at ATCS prior to the arrival of the
Division Manager.
IV. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS
6. The ITF investigation was focused on the examination of two main areas; a)
travel arrangements and cash expenses related to the official travel of ATCS staff
and b) handling of the so-called ATCS petty cash. During this investigation the ITF
Investigators:
•
Reviewed existing procedures related to the cash withdrawals in 2002 and
2003 in view of establishing whether those procedures were properly
followed and enforced by the management of ATCS;
•
Examined ATCS bank account and related records;
•
Examined the cash withdrawal requests, supporting documentation, and
receipts including airline tickets, hotel bills, and other receipts;
•
Reviewed the so-called petty cash files and related documentation;
•
Cross-checked the staff details on record and their employment roles during
the time period in question, including their official right to authorize cash
withdrawals from ATCS bank account;
•
Compared signatures found on the examined documents against the
signatures on the staff files;
•
Cross-checked specific sums against the airport “excel” cash spreadsheets
and the master bank account. (Note: the “excel” spreadsheet system has been
in place since mid-2002 and is used to maintain a “cashbook”);
•
Interviewed ATCS staff, in particular the Division Manager; the ATCS
Officials; and Finance Officers 1 and 2. ITF Investigators also interviewed
Official 1 at Prishtina Airport, and the Official 2 at Prishtina Airport.
7. During the review of available documentation, the ITF investigators
identified a number of problems related to the existing procedures and practices at
ATCS Finance Office. Having finalized the document review they interviewed
available ATCS staff that was directly involved in approving the cash withdrawals
and subsequently ATCS staff that handled the cash and related documentation at
3 of 12the ATCS Finance Office, or that travelled on training to Italy and the United
Kingdom.
8. The ITF interviewed Finance Officer 1, working at ATCS Finance Office
during the period September 2000 to December 2003. Finance Officer 1 described the
procedures that were in place during 2002 and 2003 and identified Employee 1,
Employee 2 and the Division Manager as “A” class signatories and Employee 3,
Employee 4, Employee 5 and the ATCS Official as “B” class signatories for the
UNMIK Aviation Transport and Airport Prishtina bank accounts. Those listed “A”
class signatories were the only people authorized to withdraw cash from the ATCS
bank accounts.
9. Finance Officer 1 also confirmed that the Division Manager and the ATCS
Official supervised the work of the ATCS Finance Office. He/she further indicated
that whenever there was a requirement for a larger cash payment, (for example, an
official travel), Finance Officer 1 or Finance Officer 2 would prepare a “request for
cash withdrawal” that would be signed by the ATCS Official and subsequently
assessed and approved by the Division Manager.
10. Finance Officer 1 was given the opportunity to review documentation related
to the travel of ATCS staff in 2002 prior to the takeover of the ATCS by UNMIK
Pillar 4 – KTA on 1 July 2002. During this exercise, Finance Officer 1 established that
“requests for cash” 46/2002; 49/2002; 55/2002 and 59/2002 had proper justification
sufficient for the authorization of cash allocation, but all lacked documentation that
would indicate how those funds were spent. Finance Officer 1 was not able to
provide satisfactory explanations for the identified irregularities and had no
recollection that the ATCS Official ever made any checks of the financial files at
ATCS Finance Office.
11. The ITF interviewed Finance Officer 2, working at the ATCS Finance Office,
who stated he/she has been employed by the ATCS since 01 April 2002. Finance
Officer 2 provided detailed information with regard to the financial procedures and
practices at the ATCS Finance Office and indicated that based on his/her previous
experience in dealing with finances for a number of companies (local and
international), he/she found the ATCS Finance Office to be “quite” disorganized.
For example, the office did not have in place proper structures and computer
software to deal with the financial issues including cash, even though the amounts
of money they were processing were quite high. Finance Officer 2 allegedly tried to
suggest some improvements, but the ATCS Official told him/her that it was the way
the UNMIK wanted to deal with money and that he/she should follow his/her
instructions. Since Finance Officer 2 was concerned that he/she might lose his/her
job if he/she raised any further objections, he/she decided to work as instructed by
the ATCS Official.
4 of 1212. Finance Officer 2 was given the opportunity to review the files related to the
ATCS Official travel, where he/she also identified requests 46, 49, 55 and 59 of 2002
as lacking basic documentation on how the allocated funds were spent. He/She was
not able to give satisfactory explanations to those identified irregularities.
13. Finance Officer 2 was shown documentation related to the travel of the ATCS
staff after 01 July 2002, when the ATCS was taken over by the UNMIK Pillar 4 -
KTA. Finance Officer 2 identified that the lack of documentation that was obvious
during the time period when UNMIK Pillar 2 handled Prishtina Airport, remained
the same under KTA management. Requests for cash 01/2002; 05/2002; 06/2002;
07/2002 and 08/2002 all lacked the required documentation of expenses. Finance
Officer 2 stated that the ATCS Official often claimed reimbursement for bills for food
and restaurants and he/she knew that such expenses were included in the per-diem
and that without authorisation, should not have been included in the claim for
reimbursement. In some cases, the expenses exceeded several hundred Euros per
travel. The ATCS Official instructed Finance Officer 2 to file those bills and he/she
authorised them as his/her own expenditure for ‘representation’.
14. Finance Officer 2 provided qualified insight with regard to handling of the
so-called petty cash at the ATCS Finance Office. Finance Officer 2 said that he/she
found it very strange that there was no need for any authorization or justification for
cash expenses of less than €500 and that ATCS staff were regularly bringing invoices
and bills requesting reimbursement. He/She explained that his/her role was to
check the bill/invoice and if it was deemed to comply (date, sum, stamp) he/she
would reimburse the ATCS employee. Most of the so-called petty cash during 2002
and 2003 was spent in that fashion and it was an exception if the Division Manager
or the ATCS Official asked for justifications. The sums per invoice/bill paid from the
so-called petty cash were anywhere between several Euro to over €500.
15. Finance Officer 2 was also given the opportunity to review available files
related to the so-called ATCS petty cash for any irregularities. These bills were in
particular, €525,00 “Present for International Staff”; €410,00 “Present for Official 3
(Nokia 8850)”; €918,00 “Palm organizer for the ATCS Official and Official 3” and
€1.176,00 “Recharging scratch cards VALA 900 (20*23.52) + (12*58.8)”; €960,00
“Payment for mobile phone” and €940,00 “Rent a car for the ATCS Official”.
Finance Officer 2 acknowledged that there should have been justification reports
filed with those invoices/bills, however, no such reports were found in the available
documentation. He/She further pointed out that the ATCS Official signed the
spreadsheet and therefore he assumed responsibility for those expenditures.
16. The ITF interviewed Official 4 at the Pristina Airport. Official 4 was requested
to review several files related to business travel of ATCS staff during 2002 and was
5 of 12shown documents: 46/2002; 49/2002; 55/2002 and 59/2002. He/She concluded that
all four might contain sufficient information to justify allocation of funds for the
planned travel of ATCS staff, however, none had sufficient information that would
document how those allocated funds were spent. Information contained in the file
46/2002 suggests that this document might have been created after-the-fact, as had
this request been submitted for approval on 25 May 2002 (as indicated), it would be
impossible for the approval dates written on the document to be 21 May 2002 and 22
May 2002 respectively. Also, documents attached to request 55/2002 were printouts
indicating flight reservations, but they do not prove that the travel was executed.
None of the four files contained original flight tickets, boarding passes or original
bills, nor do they contain sufficient proof that all the funds allocated to the travellers
were provided to them by the ATCS Official, as the travellers did not sign for them.
Without flight tickets and boarding passes it is not sufficiently documented that the
ATCS personnel travelled on those missions.
17. Official 4 was also requested to review the files dated after 01 July 2002, in
particular files 01/2002; 05/2002; 06/2002; 07/2002 and 08/2002. Having studied
those files, he/she concluded that the files revealed the same absence of required
documentation as the other cases identified in paragraph 16 above.
18. Official 4 was asked to review several files related to the so-called petty cash
transactions and see whether there were any irregularities. He/She concluded that
significant efforts were made by the ATCS Official to justify the cash withdrawals,
however while the cash appeared to have been provided, there was very little effort
to properly document how those funds were spent.
19 ITF Investigators interviewed the Division Manager on two occasions and
he/she explained that staff travel expenses were high because of the necessity to
train nineteen air traffic controllers, seven meteorological forecasters and six
aeronautical information service officers. All of the above staff received classroom
and on-the-job training around the world and that Pristina Airport was responsible
for expenses incurred. He/she said that the airport has no rules or regulations
regarding travel and that there are no forms to complete requesting authorization
for travel or documentation authorizing travel. The Division Manager was aware
that the ATCS Official, as the supervisor of many of those who travelled, would
frequently visit staff whilst undertaking their respective courses.
20. The Division Manager said that the ATCS Official would bring to him/her a
request in which he/she would detail the need for cash and that when the Division
Manager found the justification sufficient and in line with needs of the Airport, he
/she would approve it. The ATCS Official would then be responsible for the proper
use of these funds and keeping the financial records of the expenditure. In fact, the
ATCS Official had to sign for the bank check before it could be cashed at the bank
6 of 12and therefore he/she had the cash in his/her “custody”. The Division Manager
indicated that it was not possible for him/her to check every bill and invoice;
therefore he /she delegated the authority for financial management to the ATCS
Official.
21. The ITF interviewed Official 1 at Prishtina Airport. He/She stated that in May
2002 he/she travelled with the ATCS Official and Official 3 to the UK in order to
negotiate conditions and fine-tune the training arrangements for the ATCS staff
(request 46/2002). During this mission they all received free accommodation, all
meals were provided as well as transport from Shinfield Park to London upon their
return. When he/she returned to Prishtina he/she was not requested to return any
of the per-diem, adding that he/she knew that the ATCS Official and Official 3 also
did not return any of the allocated funds (€1158).
22. The ITF interviewed the ATCS Official on two occasions and he/she
acknowledged that cases 46/2002; 49/2002; 55/2002 and 59/2002 (the time period
up to 30 June 2002) all show numerous irregularities. He/she studied those files in
detail and concluded that all four contained sufficient information to justify the
allocation of money for the planned travel of the ATCS staff, but that the
documentation of the expenses was very poor.
23. The ATCS Official also acknowledged that cases 01/2002; 05/2002; 06/2002;
07/2002 and 08/2002 (the time period after 01 July 2002) also showed numerous
irregularities such as missing bills to prove payments, missing signatures of ATCS
staff proving that they had received the per-diem, missing flight ticket and boarding
passes proving that the travel was in fact executed. The ITF concluded that it is very
likely that those funds were paid to the ATCS employees on per-diem or salaries,
however sufficient documentation to prove those payments was not available to the
ITF investigators despite numerous attempts made in order to secure such
documentation. As a matter of practice, the ATCS Official was formally certifying
his/her own expenses during the business trips. The ATCS Official could not
provide any acceptable explanations to those irregularities.
24. The ATCS Official further indicated that his/her superiors approved all the
bills that were in the petty cash binders, including, for example: €525,00 “Present for
International Staff”; €410,00 “Present for Official 3 (Nokia 8850)”; €918,00 “Palm
organizer for the ATCS Official and Official 3”; €1.176,00 “Recharging scratch cards
VALA 900 (20*23.52) + (12*58.8)”; €960,00 “Payment for mobile phone” and €940,00
“Rent a car for Head of Department”. The ATCS Official stated that all the presents
purchased from petty cash were also approved, however, he/she could not support
this claim with any documentation. The ATCS Official added that had those bills not
been authorized, the ATCS would have not been able to get further cash as the
approval for further cash withdrawals was conditioned by proper documentation
7 of 12and certification of previous spending. He/she insisted that the sums paid for
refreshments/food/restaurant bills from the petty cash fund (hundreds of Euros)
were all authorized by his/her superiors, but that they did not request written
justifications from him/her; the bill was allegedly sufficient proof of expenditure.
25. The ATCS Official stated that in 2002, he/she was not sufficiently
experienced in financial management, therefore he/she hired Finance Officer 1 and
Finance Officer 2 who both had educational background and professional
experience in this field. He/she said that he/she was sure that the ATCS money was
spent in line with the requests, but he/she accepted that the documentation was
very poor and unacceptable, even for the minimal standards required.
26. The ATCS Official agreed that he/she and his/her staff were diligent in
requesting funds for ATCS operations, however, were generally deficient when
addressing the need for proper documentation of the actual expenditures.
27. The ATCS Official indicated that he/she trusted his/her staff; that they were
professional; and it was only very recently that he/she realized that he/she should
have devoted more effort to their supervision.
V. FINDINGS
28. It was established during the ITF investigation that ATCS management
effectively ignored the potential for fraud highlighted in the forensic audit in
2001/02. The airport was, and continues to be, exposed to financial wrongdoing.
29. The ITF investigation also clearly established that the oversight and internal
controls at the Prishtina Airport were and still remains inadequate for satisfactory
monitoring and approval of expenditure. There is no written documentation for
authorizing travel and no standard forms for tracking travel-related expenses, which
are vulnerable to fraud and should be approved and monitored more closely by
management.
30. Throughout 2002 and clearly up to February 2004, the ATCS Management, in
particular the ATCS Official, and the Division Manager failed to provide effective
oversight of the financial operations, especially those related to cash at the ATCS
Finance Office.
31. Documentation obtained by the ITF from the Prishtina Airport clearly shows
that ATCS management failed to introduce, or enforce, rules and regulations that
would guarantee proper use of the allocated funds and provided transparent
documentation of this process.
8 of 1232. A significant amount of the cash withdrawals by the ATCS was used for
training opportunities for employees of the ATCS, who attended courses in a
number of countries including Italy, Canada and the United Kingdom. Therefore,
the cash advances were not all related to the ATCS Official’s travel, rather for a
significant number of Employees. The necessity of the frequent travel of the ATCS
Official remains questionable, as the available documentation does not provide clear
proof that the ATCS Official’s travel was business related or justified.
33. By way of example, ITF Investigators examined available files related to
travel in 2002, which included details of staff attending courses. This examination
was related to the situation before and also after 01 July 2002 (Note: 0n 01 July 2002
the Pristina Airport was handed over by UNMIK Pillar 2 to UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA). It
was established that at least in nine cases (46/2002; 49/2002/55/2002; 59/2002 and
01/2002; 05/2002; 06/2002; 07/2002; 08/2002) there were significant irregularities
related to distribution of funds, documentation and filings of those financial records.
Having examined those listed files it was clearly established that in cases: 49/2002;
55/2002; 06/2002 and 07/2002 spending of € 64435 was not properly documented. It
is possible that those funds were, in fact, used for what they had been initially
allocated. However, the documentation that was available to the ITF does not
support this assumption. In case 59/2002 an overpayment of €1810 was made
without explanation as to where the additional funds were drawn. These findings
clearly demonstrate the disarray at the ATCS Finance Office in 2002.
34. The ATCS financial documentation revealed that the ATCS Official was
certifying his/her own expenses for official travel. It was clearly established by the
ITF investigation that the ATCS Official made a number of reimbursement claims
for food and restaurant bills or refreshments that were not properly authorized.
He/she also, at least in one case, did not repay €99 to the petty cash fund from
request No. 01/2002. Additionally, the ATCS Official, Official 3 and Official 1
retained a sum of €1158 of their DSA/per-diem for a business trip to the United
Kingdom in May 2002, even though they had been provided with free transport,
food and accommodation (request 46/2002).
35. In June 2002, the ATCS Official certified per-diem of € 6975 for nine
Department 1 trainees that were supposed to participate in meteorology training in
the UK. Two Department 1 staff failed their initial examination and prematurely
returned to Prishtina. The remaining seven trainees signed for their per-diem, in
total €5425. The ITF investigation established that request 59/2002 does not contain
any documentation with regards to what was done with a sum of €1550 initially
allocated by the ATCS Official for per-diem of those two ATCS employees.
36. It was established that the ATCS Finance Office used an “excel” spreadsheet
and had no alternative computerized system to deal with financial documentation.
9 of 12The procedure used required manual inputting of details of individual bank
accounts into the spreadsheet before reconciling expenditure and income against the
bank account. The system was open to abuse and was heavily reliant on individual
staff integrity.
37. The so-called ‘petty cash’ files were reviewed and it was established that the
receipts were properly filed and the figures input into the spreadsheet in most of the
cases. However, it was clearly established by the ITF investigation that during 2002,
various items were paid out of the so-called petty cash reserve without necessary
written approvals. Those items included “presents” for international and local staff
valued at several hundreds of Euros - €525,00 “Present for International Staff”;
€410,00 “Present for Official 3 (Nokia 8850)”; €918,00 “Palm organizer for the ATCS
Official and Official 3”; €1.176,00 “Recharging scratch cards VALA 900 (20*23.52) +
(12*58.8)”; €960,00 “Payment for mobile phone” and €940,00 “Rent a car for the
ATCS Official”. Additionally bills for fuel, oil, car spare-parts often did not contain
enough information, so that there was no evidence whether these payments were
done for official business purposes. Since early 2004, no cash withdrawal over €100
has been permitted, as all sums greater than that amount have to be effected by bank
transfer and formally justified.
38. The KTA, on Official 4’s behalf, is currently undertaking a procurement
process in order to identify and purchase a comprehensive automated financial
software system to replace the outdated and inadequate “excel” spreadsheet
currently in use. The new system will have the capacity to link all the financial
centres at the airport, including Customs. A significant delay has been experienced
within the KTA in initially progressing this procurement, which has now, albeit
belatedly, been addressed.
39. In addition Official 4 has submitted to the KTA Board a suggested “authority
list” that identifies authority levels for approving all aspects of expenditure. This
document was placed before the Airport Steering Committee on 16 July 2004 and
awaits ratification. Official 4 has taken active steps to ensure that sound financial
management practices were initiated and monitored since her/his recruitment in
February 2004.
VI. CONCLUSION
40. UNMIK Regulation No.: 2001/27 - Essential Labour Law in Kosovo in
paragraph 9.3. states that employees shall perform his/her obligations and may
exercise his/her rights, in accordance with the applicable law, labour contract and
where applicable collective agreement. Paragraph 11 of the same regulation states
that: quote “11.3. Serious misconduct shall include the following: … (b) theft,
destruction, damage or unauthorized use of the employer’s assets; and in 11.4.
Unsatisfactory performance shall include: … (b) repeated mistakes not sufficient in
10 of 12themselves to justify a dismissal, but which given their frequency and seriousness
disrupt the normal course of the employment relationship”.
41. The investigation conducted by the ITF clearly documented that Prishtina
Airport management failed to perform their duties in accordance with the general
principles outlined above. In particular, the use of the assets allocated to the ATCS
by the KTA in 2002 was inadequately documented and the performance of the ATCS
Finance Office in that respect was unsatisfactory. This poor performance even
caused financial damage to the UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA, as demonstrated in this
report. The work of the ATCS Finance Office was under direct supervision of the
ATCS Official and the oversight responsibility was in the hands of the Division
Manager. Both of them in their respectful capacity failed to perform their duties
according to expected standards and they failed to promote the best interest of
UNMIK Pillar 4 –KTA, as their employer.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 1: In light of the established irregularities and lack of oversight at
Prishtina Airport, UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should take appropriate action against the
ATCS Official and the Division Manager for mismanagement of the ATCS finances.
(IV04/049/01)
Recommendation 2: UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should ensure that senior management
of Prishtina Airport comply with observations and recommendations provided by
external auditors. Written responses and implementation plans should be produced
and the management team be shown how to implement changes. (IV04/049/02)
Recommendation 3: UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should ensure that all airport
management personnel share ownership and responsibility for effective financial
probity and should be reminded of this obligation. (IV04/049/03)
Recommendation 4: UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should ensure that written travel
policies and procedures should be prepared and issued without further delay and
should include the requirement for written approval for all travel, including that
undertaken by senior management. This system of travel approvals should not
permit airport senior staff to authorise their own travel request and requests for
reimbursement of expenses that occurred during said business travel. This matter
should also be brought to the attention of the airport’s steering committee for their
review. (IV04/049/04)
Recommendation 5: UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should ensure that the travel policies
should include the need for documentation to be submitted by those staff on official
travel, such as “boarding passes”, “ticket stubs” and “hotel bills” to demonstrate
evidence that travel occurred as per the approval. (IV04/049/05)
11 of 12Recommendation 6: UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should ensure that the introduction of
new financial software should be implemented without further delay. The
finalisation of this project should be monitored by the airport steering committee.
(IV04/049/06)
Recommendation 7: UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA, in collaboration with the Airport
Management team, shall re-evaluate all travel claims and the funds that were not
properly accounted for the period 01 July 2002 to date to identify any claims without
sufficient documentation and determine what action could be taken to recover
monies involved. (IV04/049/07)
Recommendation 8: The Office for Coordination of Oversight of Publicly-owned
Enterprises should monitor the implementation of the ITF recommendations. (IV

REDACTED
REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
ID CASE NO. 0580/03
23 May 2005I. INTRODUCTION
1. This report deals with a case of cheque fraud which was investigated by the Investigations
Division of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (ID/OIOS) between October 2003 and
March 2005.
2. The United Nations Office in Nairobi (UNON) reported to ID/OIOS that the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Bratislava, Slovakia had made payments to an
individual based on falsified documents for a total of US$10,079. Although the investigation did
not establish who perpetrated the fraud, it was able to establish how the fraud was committed.
The investigation also examined certain aspects of the control systems found within the finance
office, UNDP Bratislava, where the fraud occurred.
3. This report provides a description of the evidence collected by the ID/OIOS Investigators,
the findings, and makes a number of recommendations to assist management in preventing this
type of fraud.
II. ISSUES
4. Can the fraudulently induced payments be recouped?
5. Was this fraud facilitated by a United Nations staff member and, if so, can that individual
be identified?
III. APPLICABLE LAW
6. Staff Rule 101.2(g) Staff members shall not intentionally alter, destroy, misplace or
render useless any official document, record or file entrusted to them by virtue of their functions,
which document, record or file is intended to be kept as part of the records of the Organization.
7. Staff Regulation 1.2 (b): Staff members shall uphold the highest standards of efficiency,
competence and integrity.
8. Staff Regulation 1.2 (g): Staff members shall not use their office or knowledge gained
from their official functions for private gain, financial or otherwise, or for the private gain of any
third party, including family, friends and those that they favour.
9. Staff Regulation 1.2 (i) Staff members shall exercise the utmost discretion with regard to
all matters of official business. They shall not communicate to any Government, entity, person or
any other source any information known to them by reason of their official position that they
know or ought to have known has not been made public . . .
10. Fraud under Slovakian Criminal Code, 1961: Article 250, from Act 140 of the 1961
Slovakian Criminal Code whereby - “any person who does harm to the property of others or
enriches himself….... and causes harm or damage is guilty of fraud”IV. BACKGROUND
11. Per agreements between UNDP, UNHQ and UNON, UNDP country offices provide a
range of administrative services, including cash disbursements, related to programme
implementation for United Nations agencies. The UNDP country offices record the layout of
funds on Inter Office Vouchers (IOV) and bill the various agencies for these services on a
monthly basis by preparing a Report AT 036 for each agency, which has appended to it copies of
all IOVs for that agency for the month. The original AT 036 report and its attachments are sent
to UNDP HQ New York by diplomatic pouch and a copy is sent to the agency. Report AT 036 is
thereafter filed in the UNDP country finance files. In UNDP Bratislava, copies are not kept of
the attachments and the Report AT 036 does not enumerate them. This office processes about 25
cash disbursements a month.
12. In October 2003, UNON Finance was reconciling its accounts with UNDP Bratislava and
noted there was an outstanding IOV from August 2002. UNON Finance could not locate the
August 2002 Report AT 036 or its attachments. It requested these materials from UNDP
Bratislava and determined that there were two cash disbursement vouchers which could not be
reconciled: two lump sum payments to The Consultant, in the amounts of US$5,814 and
US$4,265, for travel to Johannesburg and Monrovia to attend Ozone Secretariat conferences in
August 2002 and September 2002 respectively.
13. UNON finance determined that these two vouchers were based on a genuine travel
request authorization which had been sent from UNON to the UNDP Bratislava office on 25
June 2002. The two travel requests of The Consultant changed certain details of the genuine fax,
including the name of the payee, the date, comments and the UNON fax number which is unique
to each UNON fax and is assigned in the UNON cable room, but retained, amongst other items,
the names and signatures of the authorizing officers, and the Travel Request number, which is
specific to each request.
14. UNON finance concluded that the faxes which instructed UNDP Bratislava to make these
payments were forged. Furthermore, UNEP confirmed that there were no meetings in
Johannesburg and Monrovia in 2002, that The Consultant was not UNEP’s consultant, and that
payment of lump sums to consultants for travel was irregular in any event.
V. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS
15. ID/OIOS learned that the genuine and the forged faxes were received by the registry clerk
of the UNDP Bratislava registry office and, in the normal course of business, forwarded by email
to The Finance Department Supervisor, and to Finance Assistant 1. The Finance Department
Supervisor then forwarded the genuine fax to the travel department for processing, but neither
The Finance Department Supervisor nor Finance Assistant 1 forwarded the forged faxes
elsewhere.
16. Finance Assistant 1 then emailed “The Consultant” on both occasions to notify him of the
authorization of payment and he and “The Consultant” exchanged emails to arrange the time and
means of his collection of the payment. On both occasions “The Consultant” presented himself
at the UNDP office. On one occasion, he logged in with his signature and identification number,but there was no sign-in record the other time. “The Consultant” met with someone from the
finance department, probably Finance Assistant 1, although Finance Assistant 1 has no
recollection of meeting him. In keeping with accepted practice within UNDP Bratislava and
Slovakia as a whole, whoever met with “The Consultant” had him write his name and identity
details on the back of the respective checks. However, UNDP Bratislava does not keep an
independent copy of such information. “The Consultant” also signed a cash disbursement form
and subsequently cashed both checks.
17. ID/OIOS obtained copies of the checks from the bank and acquired the identity details
from the back of the check. ID/OIOS consulted with the Slovakian police and found that neither
“The Consultant” nor his company were in their databases and the police concluded that the
identity materials provided by him when he picked up the checks were likely to be false.
ID/OIOS also found that the email account used by “The Consultant” to arrange collection of the
cheques at UNDP Bratislava had been discontinued.
18. ID/OIOS examined copies of the forged faxes which had been retained in the UNDP
Bratislava registry database. These copies had a header with UNON’s sender details, but unlike
the UNDP Bratislava hard copies in the finance files and those which had been forwarded to
UNON in October 2003, the registry copies also had a footer which reflected that they had
actually been sent from a store which provides fax services in a shopping centre near the UNDP
Bratislava office.
19. Finance Assistant 1 claimed he had not noticed the footer on them. When ID/OIOS asked
why the photocopies of the forged faxes in the UNDP finance file did not have the footer, he
disclaimed responsibility for the photocopying.
20. At the time of these incidents, two photocopying assistants had been working on an ad
hoc basis at the finance office and had access to departmental files. Photocopying Assistant 1
was a relative of The Finance Department Supervisor, and Photocopying Assistant 2, was the
daughter of Finance Assistant 2. Photocopying Assistant 2 assisted her father periodically
without pay. OIOS was informed that the two assistants helped in the preparation of the end of
month financial returns, which included retrieving documents from various files, copying them
and returning them to the files. Photocopying Assistant 1 was working at the finance office at the
relevant time period, but it has not been fully established when Photocopying Assistant 2 worked
at the office. No timesheets were kept for either assistant.
21. Review of procedures at UNON, UNEP Narobi and UNDP Bratislava in connection with
payments of this sort showed that
• UNDP Bratislava relies on the authorizing signatures on the faxes and does not verify their
authenticity with the agency;
• UNDP Bratislava maintains a sign-in sheet which requires a signature and identity
information, but it was kept haphazardly at the time of these incidents;• UNDP Bratislava disperses cheques upon proof of identity, which is recorded on the back of
the cheque, and the payee signs the original cash disbursement voucher upon receipt of the
cheque, but the finance office does not retain a copy of the payee’s proof of identification;
• UNDP Bratislava does not maintain a mail log;
• While procedures for reconciling accounts between UNON and UNDP were in place, UNON
did not attempt to reconcile the August 2002 UNDP Bratislava account for more than a year
after it was purportedly submitted; and
• UNEP Narobi stated that it has had several problems with fraudulent payments by UNDP
offices.
VI. FINDINGS
Issue One: Can the fraudulently induced payments be recovered from The Consultant?
22. ID/OIOS, with the assistance of the Slovakia police, has not been able to ascertain the
identity of “The Consultant.” However, “The Consultant,” if identified and found, would be
subject to prosecution under the Slovakian penal code.
Issue Two: Was this fraud facilitated by a United Nations staff member and, if so, can that
individual be identified?
23. ID/OIOS has established that the genuine UNON fax number was photocopied and
altered to produce The Consultant’s fax requests. It has also established that the forged faxes
were transmitted locally, which suggests that this fraud was carried out in Slovakia.
24. Whoever forged the faxes had to have access to the genuine fax and knowledge of the
format and function of the travel requests and the procedures used in processing these requests.
25. The fact that UNON finance did not receive the Report AT 036 and the appended IOV
although the cover letter to UNON was filed at UNDP Bratislava, suggests that someone with
knowledge and access manipulated the system to delay discovery of the fraud. Furthermore, the
photocopies of the forged faxes which were filed with the Report AT 036 were copied without
the identifying footer, which also suggests an intent to delay discovery of the fraud.
26. Consequently, it is highly probable that this fraud was facilitated by a UNDP Bratislava
staff member, probably in the finance department, but ID/OIOS Investigators were not able to
determine who was responsible.
27. If a staff member is found to have facilitated this fraud, he could be charged with
violation of Staff Rule 101.2(g), Staff Regulation 1.2(b), (g) and (i), and would be subject to
prosecution under the Slovakian penal code.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
28. In the light of the preceding findings and conclusions, OIOS makes the following
recommendations:Recommendation 1: It is recommended that UNDP revise the system in place for verification
and payment of travel authorization requests to enhance and safeguard procedures and prevent
fraud. (Rec. No. IV/03/580/01)
Recommendation 2: It is recommended that UNDP Bratislava retain copies of identification
provided by payees to assist in later identity check requirements. (Rec. No. IV/03/580/02)
Recommendation 3: It is recommended that UNDP Bratislava avoid nepotism and maintain
proper records time and pay records for part time employees. (Rec. No. IV/03/580/03)
Recommendation 4: It is recommended that all Agencies utilizing the services of UNDP use the
Atlas electronic payment and financial accounts system which checks the authenticity of an
authorization and creates an electronic log of events. (Rec. No. IV/03/580/04)
Recommendation 5: It is recommended that the United Nations establish a secure intranet
website for travel claims which would permit authorization levels for receiving and making
payments, and offer a built in electronic audit tracking facility. (Rec. No. IV/03/580/05)
Recommendation 6: It is recommended that UNDP request the Slovakian Police to investigate
this matter. (Rec. No. IV/03/580/06)","[('UNITED NATIONS NATIONS UNIES\n', 'ORG'), ('18', 'CARDINAL'), ('7 September 1994', 'DATE'), ('23 May 2005I.', 'DATE'), ('the Investigations\nDivision of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (ID/OIOS)', 'ORG'), ('between October 2003', 'DATE'), ('The United Nations Office', 'ORG'), ('Nairobi', 'GPE'), ('UNON', 'ORG'), ('ID/OIOS', 'ORG'), ('the United\nNations Development Programme', 'ORG'), ('UNDP', 'ORG'), ('Bratislava', 'GPE'), ('Slovakia', 'GPE'), ('US$10,079.', 'LAW'), ('UNDP Bratislava', 'ORG'), ('United Nations', 'ORG'), ('APPLICABLE LAW', 'LAW'), ('6', 'CARDINAL'), ('8', 'CARDINAL'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('Slovakian Criminal Code', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('1961', 'DATE'), ('250', 'CARDINAL'), ('Act 140', 'DATE'), ('Slovakian Criminal Code', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('-', 'CARDINAL'), ('…....', 'DATE'), ('11', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNDP', 'ORG'), ('UNHQ', 'ORG'), ('UNON', 'ORG'), ('UNDP', 'ORG'), ('United Nations', 'ORG'), ('UNDP', 'ORG'), ('Inter Office Vouchers (', 'ORG'), ('036', 'CARDINAL'), ('the month.', 'DATE'), ('036', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNDP HQ New York', 'ORG'), ('036', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNDP', 'ORG'), ('UNDP Bratislava', 'ORG'), ('036', 'CARDINAL'), ('about 25', 'CARDINAL'), ('month', 'DATE'), ('October 2003', 'DATE'), ('UNDP Bratislava', 'ORG'), ('IOV', 'ORG'), ('August 2002', 'DATE'), ('August 2002', 'DATE'), ('036', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNDP\nBratislava', 'ORG'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), (': two', 'CARDINAL'), ('US$5,814', 'LAW'), ('Johannesburg', 'GPE'), ('Monrovia', 'GPE'), ('Secretariat', 'ORG'), ('August 2002', 'DATE'), ('September 2002', 'DATE'), ('.', 'DATE'), ('13', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNON', 'ORG'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNON', 'ORG'), ('Bratislava', 'GPE'), ('25\nJune 2002', 'DATE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNON', 'ORG'), ('UNON', 'ORG'), ('UNON', 'ORG'), ('14', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNON', 'ORG'), ('UNDP Bratislava', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('Johannesburg', 'GPE'), ('Monrovia', 'GPE'), ('2002', 'DATE'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('UNDP Bratislava', 'ORG'), ('The Finance Department Supervisor', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('The Finance Department Supervisor', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('16', 'CARDINAL'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNDP', 'ORG'), ('.', 'DATE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNDP Bratislava', 'ORG'), ('Slovakia', 'GPE'), ('UNDP Bratislava', 'ORG'), ('Slovakian', 'GPE'), ('UNDP Bratislava', 'ORG'), ('UNON', 'ORG'), ('Bratislava', 'GPE'), ('October 2003', 'DATE'), ('Bratislava', 'GPE'), ('.\n19.

2I. INTRODUCTION
1. The Investigations Division of the Office of Internal
Oversight Services (OIOS) received several emails sent to
persons external to the Organization, which alleged that
wrongdoings were committed at the Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA) but no action was taken. One of the authors of the said
emails was a staff member of ECA.
2. Subsequently, an investigation was conducted that revealed
that contrary to UN Rules and Regulations, the staff member sent
emails to His Excellency, Ambassador John Negroponte of the US
Mission to the UN, the President and Vice-President of the
United States of America, Senator John Kerry and Senator Dodd of
the United States Senate amongst others.
II. APPLICABLE LAW
3. Regulation 1.2 (i) of the Staff Regulations provides that
“Staff members shall exercise the utmost discretion with regard
to all matters of official business. They shall not communicate
to any Government, entity, person or any other source any
information known to them by reason of their official position
that they know or ought to have known has not been made public,
except as appropriate in the normal course of their duties or by
authorization of the Secretary-General. These obligations do
not cease upon separation from service”.
III. METHODOLOGY
4. OIOS investigation of this matter entailed obtaining and
analyzing relevant documents. Staff members were also
interviewed including the staff member.
IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
5. The staff member worked in ECA at the P5 level. He retired
at the end of November 2003 having worked for the Organization
for over 25 years.
3V. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS
A. “Hiwot Abebe” email of 26 January 2003
6. During the course of the investigation, it was revealed
that on 26 January 2003, an anonymous person, using the
identities of “Hiwot Abebe” sent an email to the President and
Vice-President of the United States of America. The email was
also addressed to Senator John Kerry and Senator Dodd of the
United States Senate. The email had an attachment that was
addressed to the Executive Secretary of ECA and highlighted
allegations of sexual harassment and rape perpetrated by some
senior officials of ECA within the ECA Complex. The title to
the attachment was “Crimes of Rape and Maladministration within
the compound of ECA”. The document was also copied to the
Secretary-General, Ethiopian Foreign Ministry and senior
officials in the UN System.
7. “Abebe’s” complaint to the American Government was that the
Executive Secretary, ECA had failed to take action against staff
members who were alleged to have sexually harassed and raped ten
women staff members of ECA. “Abebe” was therefore asking the
American Government to intervene on behalf of the aggrieved
women.
8. The above email and the attachment were copied to the staff
member and other persons working in the Organization.
B. Email submitted by the staff member to
Ambassador Negroponte
and US Government Officials
9. On 28 January 2003, the staff member wrote an email to His
Excellency, Ambassador John Negroponte of the US Mission to the
UN and “Hiwot”. He also copied the email to the President and
Vice - President of the United States of America, Senator John
Kerry and Senator Dodd of the United States Senate. In
addition, he attached to the email the document alleging rape
and sexual harassment by some officials of ECA - “Crimes of Rape
and Maladministration within the compound of ECA”. On the same
day White House responded and thanked the staff member for
emailing President Bush and Vice - President Cheney.
10. In his email to Ambassador Negroponte, the staff member
informed him that the aggrieved staff members had exhausted all
avenues available for recourse under the UN justice system. The
staff member therefore appealed to Ambassador Negroponte to
4intervene by drawing this to the attention of the Secretary-
General.
C. Interview of the staff member
11. In his interview with the Investigators, the staff member
initially denied sending the email and the attachment in
question to Ambassador Negroponte and other persons outside the
UN System. Later he conceded that he wrote to the Ambassador in
his capacity as a staff representative after the aggrieved staff
members approached him for assistance.
12. The staff member stated that there were ten women staff
members who were victims of sexual harassment at ECA. When the
Investigators requested the staff member to provide the names of
the ten women staff members, he refused to do so. He stated that
he was actually told about the allegations by a Staff Union
member who confided to him that the allegations were true. The
staff member refused to disclose the name of the staff member to
the Investigators.
13. When the staff member was asked why he sought assistance
from Ambassador Negroponte, a non-UN staff member, his response
was that the aggrieved staff members who were working as a group
felt that the issue was taking a long time to resolve;
therefore, he decided to appeal to Ambassador Negroponte. He
said that he did not consult ECA management before writing to
persons outside the Organization as the ECA internal justice
system seemed to have collapsed. He said that his conscience
was clear that sexual harassment did happen and that was why he
had intervened on behalf of the female staff members.
14. The staff member stated that the sexual harassment issue
was raised and addressed at several staff and management
meetings by the Executive Secretary. In this connection, on 18
March 2003, the Executive Secretary wrote a memorandum to the
Officer-in-Charge, OHRM responding to all the allegations
leveled against the management of ECA. On the allegation of
sexual harassment, the Executive Secretary concluded by stating
that it was “totally unfounded and simply ridiculous and
preposterous”.
D. Emails by the staff member to Mr. Mzumara, OIC, SRO, Lusaka
15. On 29 January 2003, the staff member wrote an email to Mr.
Dickson Mzumara, Officer-in-Charge of the ECA Sub Regional
Office in Lusaka, Zambia confirming that he had written to
Ambassador Negroponte because he had had a chat with friends who
5thought that “this was too much of a hot potato”. Mr. Mzumara
was also a recipient of a copy of the email that was addressed
to Ambassador Negroponte by the staff member.
16. On the same day, Mr. Mzumara replied through an email to
the staff member and concurred with his action of writing to the
Ambassador. However, Mr. Mzumara pointed out to the staff
member that he was concerned that he, the staff member, was
writing to persons outside the Organization. Mr. Mzumara stated
that “Yes I thought as much. My concern was you were going out
of the system and this is not in line with the Conditions of
Service. See what comes out of it”. The staff member responded
via email dated 29 January 2003 and stated that, “Thanks that I
have been told. This question was brought in the JAB in
Nairobi. With a few phone calls, the case was shelved. The
lady who broadcasted the message is the one who wrote to White
House and the Vice Presidents of the USA. If the internal
justice system had functioned every thing would have been kept
within the system. My hope was Negroponte being in the UN
Secretariat would do damage control and get somehow the Boss to
address the problem, in the best interest of the Secretary
General. The ladies will continue writing to Human Rights
Organizations, especially those that are fired. It may not
produce immediate results but a lot of damage will be done”. He
added that he wrote to the Ambassador “to show the man that
dialogue is the best option in life”.
E. Interview with Mr. Dickson Mzumara
17. Mr. Mzumara recalled that in January 2003, the concerned
staff member who retired in November 2003 wrote to US Ambassador
Negroponte concerning grievances of sexual harassment at ECA.
He said that after he received a copy of that communication
through email, he wrote to the staff member and advised him that
it was contrary to UN Regulations for him to communicate with
persons external to the Organization. In connection with this
communication, Mr. Mzumara advised the staff member to tender a
letter of resignation.
F. Allegations of Sexual Harrassment
18. The allegation of sexual harassment made by one of the
female staff members named in the anonymous letters was
investigated by OIOS/ID. She had complained that her contract
was terminated after she had turned down the sexual advances of
a manager.
619. The female staff member informed OIOS that during an office
retreat held at the Nazareth Restaurant in 2001, the manager was
at the coffee shop with two other staff members, Mr. Oluwatete
Olokodana, Deputy Chief of Security and Mr. Vintzislav Stokykov,
Chief, Facilities Management Section, when the manager
approached her saying, “why are you wearing this, it’s too hot
here”. Whilst saying this he put his hand on her T-shirt and
tried to look and touch her breast.
20. When interviewed, Mr. Olokodana said that he did not
witness any sexual harassment at the retreat. However, in the
presence of Mr. Stoykov, he recalled that the female staff
member complained to the manager that she was not feeling well
whilst they were having lunch.
21. OIOS interviewed Mr. Stoykov who said that such an incident
did not occur. However, he recalled the female staff member
being in the company of the manager, Mr. Olokodana and himself
when she came to complain that she had flu whilst they were
having coffee.
22. The manager told OIOS that he did not sexually harass the
female staff member and that such allegations are made when
staff members are dissatisfied with certain managerial
decisions. He said that the female staff member’s contract was
terminated because her performance was poor.
23. When the female staff member was re-interviewed by ID/OIOS,
she maintained that she had been sexually harassed. When asked
why she had not engaged the various possible internal systems,
including OHRMS to have the issue resolved, she stated that she
had not pursued the issue because she did not know how to
approach it. The female staff member explained that she thinks
that her contract was not renewed because of the sexual
harassment. The female staff member left the employment of ECA
some two years ago and has never taken any steps to engage any
United Nations system options to pursue her complaint.
24. In light of the above, there is therefore insufficient
evidence to support the female staff member’s allegation of
sexual harassment. Both Mr. Olokodana and Mr. Stoykov whom she
claimed witnessed the incident deny that any incident occurred
and reported a substantially different exchange.
25. Ms. Bongoy – Mawalla, Chief General Services Section
explained to OIOS that she was the focal point for women until
July 2003. She said that during her tenure, she issued a
7circular to create awareness about sexual harassment but no
incident was reported by staff members.
26. During interviews with OIOS, Mr. Ali Todaro, Special
Assistant to the Executive Secretary also denied sexually
harassing women staff members at ECA as alleged in the anonymous
emails. Because those women were not named and the staff member
refused to identify them to ID/OIOS, it was not possible to
further pursue the allegations.
VI. EVIDENCE, FINDINGS OF FACT
27. As indicated above, Staff Regulation 1.2 (i) stipulates
that staff members shall not communicate to any Government,
entity, person or any other source any official information that
they know has not been made public except as appropriate in the
normal course of their duties or by authorization by the
Secretary General. These obligations do not cease upon
separation from service.
28. Email messages sent to US Ambassador Negroponte, President
Bush, Vice President Cheney, Senators and other persons external
to the Organization by The staff member is a contravention of
the above Staff Regulation. The reason for so doing –
especially in light of his refusal to identify the sources of
the complaints he was ostensibly raising to the OIOS
Investigators when asked – appears evident in The staff member’s
reply to Mr. Mzumara who told him his actions contravened Staff
Regulations. The staff member had at the time indicated that,
“ ----- if the internal justice system had functioned every
thing would have been kept within the system. My hope was
Negroponte being in the UN Secretariat would do damage control
and get somehow the Boss to address the problem, in the best
interest of the Secretary General. The ladies will continue
writing to Human Rights Organizations, especially those that are
fired. It may not produce immediate results but a lot of damage
will be done”.
29. During interviews with the OIOS Investigators, by his own
admission, the staff member confirmed communicating to persons
outside the Organization. He did not inform ECA management
arguing that the ECA internal justice system had collapsed.
However, he knew that the matter was being dealt with by the
Executive Secretary as confirmed by him during his interview
with the Investigators.
8VII. CONCLUSION
30. In light of the above findings, it is evident that the
staff member contravened Staff Regulation 1.2 (i). He sought
intervention from US Ambassador Negroponte and other persons who
were external to the Organization. Further, the staff member
disseminated emails that he knew were not to be made public
without authorization from the Secretary-General.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 1
It is recommended that this investigation report be placed in
the staff member’s Personnel Status File; (ID Rec. No.
IV03/570/01)
Recommendation 2
It is recommended that Office of Legal Affairs (OLA) send to the
staff member a cease and desist letter pointing out that though
separated from the Organization he has an obligation not to
disseminate official UN information as provided for in
Regulation 1.2(i) of the Staff Regulations “Staff members shall
exercise the utmost discretion with regard to all matters of
official business. They shall not communicate to any
Government, entity, person or any other source any information
known to them by reason of their official position that they
know or ought to have known has not been made public, except as
appropriate in the normal course of their duties or by
authorization of the Secretary-General. These obligations do
not cease upon separation from service”.

2I. INTRODUCTION
1. The Investigations Division, Office of Internal Oversight Services (ID/OIOS)
received a complaint that an Economic Commission of Africa (ECA) staff member
misappropriated the sum of US$12,000 that was intended as Daily Subsistence
Allowance (DSA) for five participants attending a conference in Seychelles. This
complaint, received in 2001 some two years after the alleged commission of the
misappropriation, did not provide the name of the conference, when it was held, or the
name of the subject. In the course of its preliminary investigation, soon after receipt of
this matter, ID/OIOS learned that the complainant no longer worked at ECA and was
inaccessible through other contact numbers given to ID/OIOS. In spite of these
difficulties however, ID/OIOS subsequently investigated this case during one of its ECA
missions when it found time to do so for the purpose of ascertaining whether the theft
could be corroborated and if so, identifying the perpetrator and any system weaknesses.
II. APPLICABLE LAWS
2. Staff Regulation 1.2 (g)
Staff members shall not use their office or knowledge gained from their official functions
for private gain, financial or otherwise, or for the private gain of any third party,

3III. METHODOLOGY
5. ID/OIOS interviewed the ACGD Officer, ECA’s Official 1, and other staff
members. Investigators also obtained and analyzed documents including personnel
records, bank records and the list of participants for the Seychelles conference
indicating who was paid DSA.
IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
6. ID/OIOS determined that the conference in question was “An Eastern and
Southern Africa Sub Regional Meeting” and was held from 15 to 18 February, 1999 at
the Berjaja Mahe Beach Resort Hotel in Victoria, Seychelles. It was organized by the
African Centre for Women (ACW), now the African Centre for Gender Development
(ACGD).
7. This conference attracted over 100 participants, 46 of whom were sponsored by
ECA. The rest were sponsored by other international organizations.
8. When ECA finances a conference, a list of participants is prepared and then a
travel request (a “PT.8”) is prepared for each participant. The PT.8 is certified by the
Director of the Division and sent to the Finance Division, which verifies that the correct
account number is quoted and that there is sufficient money to honor the request. It is
then recorded in the Integrated Management Information System (IMIS), which
demonstrates approval of the request. A letter to UNDP referencing the PT.8 number and
account number is prepared and the Finance Division approves that letter before it is sent
to UNDP for payment to be made to the attendee.
9. Typically when ECA sponsors a conference, it arranges with the UNDP office in
the country in which the conference is held to pay DSA to participants. However, there
was no UNDP office in the Seychelles. Consequently the airfares and 50 per cent of DSA
were paid to participants by UNDP offices in each participant’s country and the ACGD
Officer was entrusted with the payment of the remaining 50 per cent of DSA to
participants while they were at the conference. When UNDP makes its payments, it
sends an inter-office voucher (IOV) to ECA indicating the amount of money they have
spent and ECA reimburses UNDP. If the DSA was not paid and ticket not issued by
UNDP, then an IOV credit is sent to the Finance Division. Cancellation of a PT.8
indicates that that person did not attend the conference, and the UNDP office in question
would then issue an IOV credit to ECA.
V. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS
10. In an inter-office memorandum dated 19 January 2000, Official 3 asked the
ACGD Officer to settle relevant claims and to provide supporting documentation for the
4US$49,000 the ACGD Officer had received for payment of DSA and other miscellaneous
expenses at the conference. In a subsequent inter-office memorandum dated 17 February
2000, Official 4 specifically questioned the payment of DSA to five people who had
apparently not attended the 1999 Seychelles conference.
11. ID/OIOS Investigators observed that of the five PT.8 reference numbers referred
to by Official 4 in his memorandum of 17 February 2000, one was repeated and another
PT.8 had in fact not been cancelled, leaving three rather than five apparently
inappropriately disbursed DSA payments in the amount of US$3,011. The attendance list
showed that the PT.8’s in question were for Participant 1, Participant 2 and Participant 3.
12. ID/OIOS obtained the following documentation for the money disbursed to the
ACGD Officer for the payment of DSA.
(a) Official 5 authorized Official 6 to pay the ACGD Officer the sum of
US$40,000: US$35,000 for the remaining half of the DSA to be paid to the conference
participants and US$5,000 for miscellaneous expenses.
(b) Official 5 authorized the payment of a further sum of US$9,000 to the
ACGD Officer for DSA to be paid to the conference participants.
13. Receipt of payment of US$49,000 was confirmed as follows:
(a) Advice notes from Barclays Bank PLC Independence Square (“Barclays”)
confirm that US$49,300 was paid to the ACGD Officer. Barclays overpaid the ACGD
Officer US$300 and debited this amount from UNDP’s account.
(b) A letter dated 8 March 2000 from Official 7 of UNDP office in Mauritius,
confirmed that the ACGD Officer received US$49,000: US$44,000 of which was to pay
50 per cent DSA to participants.
14. In an inter-office memorandum dated 18 February 2000, both Official 2 and the
ACGD Officer responded to Official 4’s 17 February 2000 inquiry of payment of DSA to
persons whose PT.8’s were cancelled and had not attended the conference. Official 2
stated that the funds transferred to Seychelles by ECA were managed by herself, the
ACGD Officer and the UNDP Officer in Port Louis, Seychelles. She further stated that
the amount transferred to pay the remaining 50 per cent of DSA was only made available
after the end of the conference, which created chaos in paying participants before their
departures. In addition, Barclays did not have sufficient smaller US denominations and
proposed the use of French francs. Consequently it was agreed that the ACGD Officer
would give Barclays the list of participants and the bank itself would make the remaining
DSA payments.
15. That memorandum also stated that:
5(a) The ACGD Officer had received US$5,000 and US$3,500 to cover
miscellaneous expenses. He also received US$22,000 in notes late 18 February 1999,
US$3,327 in notes and US$3,300 in travellers’ cheques early on 19 February 1999 to
facilitate the payment of DSA;
(b) Payment of DSA was handled directly by Barclays’ representative in the
presence of UNDP Liaison Officer Lucas and the ACGD Officer; and
(c) The bank tellers directly paid participants US$12,173. The ACGD Officer
stated, “The DSA payment included under the bank slip in the amount of US$10,120.00
and US$2,053.00 which was made on 19 February 1999 was handled at the bank
counter…”
16. According to Barclays’ letter dated 27 June 2000 and Official 4’s memorandum
of March 3, 2000, the ACGD Officer received the sums of US$22,000 and US$3,327 in
notes and US$3,300 in travellers’ cheques for the payment of participants. The bank paid
participants DSA in the sums of US$10,120 and US$2,053.
17. When interviewed the ACGD Officer told ID/OIOS that Official 2 had asked him
to pay miscellaneous expenses and DSA to the participants of the Seychelles conference.
He said that ECA had written to UNDP Mauritius, who asked UNDP HQ for authority to
transfer funds to Barclays in Seychelles. The ACGD Officer then cashed the funds and
disbursed DSA to participants.
18. He said that on 17 February 1999 he paid the first group of participants at the
hotel in the presence of the UNDP Officer. He indicated his payment to participants on
the list by placing asterisks against their names. On 18 February 1999 Barclays paid the
other participants using the attendance list supplied by the ACGD Officer. Upon receipt
of identification from the payees, the bank tellers had the participant sign his/her name on
the attendance list and paid the DSA. The ACGD Officer said that he was present when
the bank tellers paid the remaining participants and that after the payments were made,
the attendance list was returned to him.
19. The ACGD Officer confirmed that it was his responsibility to ensure that
participants received their DSA and signed their names against the attendance list upon
receipt of their DSA. Lack of a signature against a name meant that that person did not
attend the conference.
20. The ACGD Officer provided ID/OIOS with the attendance list during the course
of his interview. Of the three queried payments, there was an asterisk only against
Participant 1’s name on the attendance list.
21. He said that for persons who did not attend the conference, instructions had to be
given for their PT.8’s to be cancelled. There were no cancellations before the conference
but they were four to five after the conference.
622. ID/OIOS Investigators observed that the PT.8’s for Participant 1, Participant 2
and Participant 3 were all cancelled after the conference by Official 2.
23. The ACGD Officer explained the cancellation of PT.8’s after the conference by
saying that some governments substituted participants a few days before the conference.
As a result of such late cancellations and/or substitutions it is only after the conference
that instructions are given to cancel and amend the relevant PT.8 forms accordingly.
24. ID/OIOS showed the ACGD Officer three cancelled PT.8’s.
(a) The ACGD Officer examined the cancelled PT.8 for Participant 1, and
said that she had not attended the conference. But when shown a signature and asterisk
against her name on the attendance list, indicating payment of US$1,000 in DSA, he said
that he could not confirm whether he had given instructions to cancel the PT.8 and that it
was possible that it had been done by the Director.
(b) The ACGD Officer was shown a cancelled PT.8 for Participant 2. Upon
seeing a signature against this name (but no asterisk) as having received US$1,068 in
DSA, he told ID/OIOS that the secretaries could have gotten the wrong information or
the Director may have given the wrong instructions for the travel to be cancelled.
(c) The ACGD Officer was shown a cancelled PT.8 for Participant 3. Upon
seeing a signature against this name (but no asterisk) as having received US$943 in DSA,
he said that it was a mistake similar to that of the case of Participant 2.
(d) In all of these cases the PT.8’s were cancelled by Official 2 on 19 March
1999, after the conference.
25. The ACGD Officer explained these discrepancies by suggesting that a bank
employee might have tampered with the DSA list and forged signatures of participants
who did not attend and then pocketed their DSA. He said that he dealt with the manager;
a teller and a go-between person and that any one of them could have falsely signed the
DSA list. However, he had previously acknowledged that he had witnessed the payments
being made by the Bank staff and he had not raised any questions or concerns then or at
any time before being questioned by ID/OIOS Investigators on this point. However, he
claimed to be surprised by the discrepancies pointed out by ID/OIOS. He then
acknowledged that he had received memoranda from Official 4 asking him to account,
amongst other things, for the moneys that he had been given for DSA, but he thought that
the matter had been settled despite the unaccounted discrepancies.
26. ID/OIOS, in a telephone interview with Participant 3, asked if she had attended the
Seychelles conference and she stated that she had not. She added that she had not been
invited to attend and had not received any DSA for this conference.
727. In a second interview with the ACGD Officer by phone, he was told that
Participant 3 confirmed that she had not attended the conference. He again said that he
had not paid all the participants, Barclays had paid some, and that the situation during
payment was chaotic. He said it was difficult to remember whom he paid and there could
have been errors.
28. ID/OIOS attempted to interview Participant 1 and Participant 2 but was unable to
locate them at the contact numbers provided. ID/OIOS also attempted to locate the
UNDP Officer, but the UNDP Liaison office had been closed in 1999 and attempts to
locate her through other UNDP contacts proved futile. The ACGD Officer was unable to
provide ID/OIOS with the names of bank personnel who were involved with the DSA
payments.
29. ID/OIOS interviewed a staff member, who said that each person attending the
conference was required to register and that a list of these attendees were then compiled
and included in a Report that was prepared on the Conference. She told ID/OIOS that
this list is usually accurate but could at times contain errors, for instance if the list was
prepared before the conference rather than from the Register, it might not be accurate.
ID/OIOS reviewed the list included in the Report and noted that the names of Participant
1, Participant 2 and Participant 3 were not included.
30. When ID/OIOS first asked the ACGD Officer on April 28, 2003 how much money
he had received for the payment of DSA, he said that he had only received US$5,000 for
miscellaneous expenses. However when ID Investigators showed the ACGD Officer
Barclays’ documents with his signature, indicating that he had received US$22,000, he
admitted that it was his signature and that he had in fact received US$22,000 from the
bank for payment of DSA. Although the bank records show that the ACGD Officer had
also received US$3,327 in cash for DSA payment and US$3,300 in travellers’ cheques - a
total of US$28,627, the ACGD Officer said that he could not remember having received
these sums of money. He also confirmed that he had signed for the receipt of the funds
Barclays paid out. ID reminded the ACGD Officer of the contents of his memorandum of
18 February 2000 where he acknowledged receipt of additional sums and he admitted the
contents of that memorandum.
31. The ACGD Officer said that in June 1999 he prepared a report and submitted a
certificate of expenses to Officer 8 of the Disbursement Unit. The report was reviewed
by Official 2, who signed the memorandum forwarding the report.
32. Official 2 was not present at the time of ID/OIOS’s mission to ECA.
Consequently, ID/OIOS forwarded certain questions in relation to the Seychelles
conference and she furnished answers.
33. ID/OIOS asked Official 2 if she was satisfied that the ACGD Officer gave a
proper explanation for the apparent discrepancies and whether there was a final report.
She responded by saying that the ACGD Officer had provided a comprehensive
explanation of the apparent discrepancies to Official 4. She placed the blame for
8improper payment of DSA on Barclays since the bank staff made the payments, but does
not take into account the ACGD Officer’s acknowledgement of witnessing these same
payments or his responsibility for the safeguarding of the funds entrusted to him. She
also said that following the ACGD Officer’s correspondence of 24 March 2000, a
meeting was called by Official 5 to discuss the issue with the ACGD Officer and Official
3. Subsequently, instruction was given by the Director of PPFD to close the account with
the submitted supporting documents.
34. ID/OIOS reviewed the ACGD Officer’s memorandum dated 24 March 2000. In
that memorandum the ACGD Officer confirmed that DSA was paid to the bearers of the
five PT.8 numbers to which Official 4 referred. He agreed that payment of DSA to non-
attendees was a serious matter, but, as had Official 2, placed the blame on Barclays,
claiming that the bank had paid the DSAs.
35. ID/OIOS observed that Official 2 and the ACGD Officer stated in their joint
memorandum of 18 February 2000 that the ACGD Officer had paid some participants
DSA and Barclays paid the rest. However, both Official 2 and the ACGD Officer when
interviewed, and the ACGD Officer in his memorandum of 24 March 2000, claimed
Barclays had paid all the DSA.
36. In memorandum dated 13 April 2000 from Official 3 to Official 4, Official 3
recommended that an independent investigation be conducted into the matter because
despite requests for more documentation and explanations, the ACGD Officer did not
properly account for the expenses of the meeting.
VI. FINDINGS OF FACT
Issue 1: Did the ACGD Officer inappropriately use his office for financial gain?
37. The ACGD Officer confirmed at his interviews that he was entrusted with payment
of miscellaneous expenses and DSA to participants at the Seychelles conference. In his
interoffice memorandum of 18 February 2004, [see paragraphs 14 and 15], he admitted
that he had collected US$28,627 for these payments. Although the allegation was that
US$12,000 had been misappropriated, ID/OIOS found that only US$3,011 was
unaccounted for [see paragraph 11]. The attendance list used for payment of DSA had no
asterisk against the name of Participant 3 and Participant 2 (indicating that the Barclays
had “paid” them), but there was an asterisk against the name of Participant 1 - a system
devised by the ACGD Officer which was used by him to indicate that he had made a
specific payment, in this instance indicating that the ACGD Officer had “paid” her [see
paragraph 18].
38. The ACGD Officer’s theory that the Barclay Bank staff were responsible does not
withstand scrutiny. First, he acknowledges that he witnessed the payments made by the
Bank; second, while the Bank may have performed this service for him, he retained
responsibility for the accounting for the funds given to him; third, nowhere else had The
9ACGD Officer claimed that the bank staff took the funds until he was questioned by
Investigators including at the time the disbursements were made and later when
questioned about the discrepancies by ECA managers.
Issue 2: Did The ACGD Officer appropriately safeguard the cash advances for the
conference and did he properly account for these advances as required by Financial Rule
104.9?
39. Official 3 asked the ACGD Officer for an accounting of US$49,000 he had
received for payment of DSA and other expenses at the conference in his inter-office
memorandum of 19 January 2000 [see paragraph 10]. In his inter-office memorandum of
18 February 2004, the ACGD Officer admitted collecting US$38,627 for payment of
DSA to participants at the conference [see paragraph 15.a]. However, in his interview of
April 28, 2003, he first claimed that he had only received US$5,000 (for miscellaneous
expenses), but then admitted he had received US$22,000 [see paragraph 30]. The ACGD
Officer blamed the chaotic atmosphere during payment of DSA for any discrepancies.
However, it is apparent that he did not safeguard and protect the cash advances for the
conference as required by Financial Rule 104.9, nor did he provide a proper accounting
of these funds.
Issue 3: Did the ACGD Officer keep proper records of payment of DSA and other
conference expenses as required by Financial Rule 104.10 (b) and (c)?
40. By the ACGD Officer’s admission in paragraph 27, payments of DSA at the
conference were chaotic and there could have been errors for which he bears full
responsibility as the person assigned to make the disbursement of these United Nations
funds. In addition, receipt of funds was indicated only by signature next to a name on the
attendance list. This is not proper recording of disbursements as required by Financial
Rule 104.10 (b) and (c).
VII. CONCLUSIONS
41. The signatures for three people on the attendance list, who did not attend the
conference, were forged and the disbursements to them unaccounted for, resulting in a
loss of US$3,011 to ECA. There are only two possibilities: first, that the ACGD Officer
forged the signatures and retained the money and second, that a bank employee forged
the signatures and kept the money despite the ACGD Officer’s presence during the
disbursement process and he failed to notice or to raise the issue. Either way, the ACGD
Officer is responsible for the loss of funds.
42. It is of additional concern that despite questions raised regarding the loss of the
funds and the failure to safeguard the money on the part of the ACGD Officer, ECA
managers did not take measures to hold him accountable or to determine whether the
manner of handling the funds in this case might warrant further scrutiny for the purpose
of avoiding similar problems in future.
10VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 1
It is recommended that appropriate action be taken against the ACGD Officer, including
for being in breach of Financial Rule 104.9 and 104.10 (b) and (c). (ID Rec. No.
IV01/202/01)
Recommendation 2
It is recommended that ECA management review its cash disbursement practices for
additional gaps and examine this case for lessons learned to avoid similar problems in
future. (ID Rec. No. IV01/202/02)

SUBJECT Allegations of misconduct occurring in the Post-Conflict Assessment Unit
-
(PCAU) of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP)
ID Case No. 0374103
OBJET:
1. The Investigations Division of the Office of Internal Oversight Services
(ID/OIOS) received a report of alleged wrongdoing in the Balkans Task Force (BTF) and
in the Post-Conflict Assessment Unit (PCAU) of the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP). The complaints are against two UNEP Staff Members, and a
UNEPIPCAU Consultant, all of whom are from the same country and had previously
worked together.
(i) Allegation 1. While working for the BTF and PCAU, UNEP Staff Member 1,
UNEP Staff Member 2, and UNEP/PCAU Consultant maintained an ongoing
relationship with their former company, thereby creating a conflict of interest.
(ii) Allegation 2. UNEP Staff Member 1 demanded a kickback of fifty percent
of consultancy fees paid to experts and these fees were shared with UNEP Staff
Member 2 and UNEP/PCAU Consultant.
(iii) Allegation 3. UNEP Staff Member 1 and UNEP Staff Member 2 received
high-level contracts without meeting the proper educational and professional
qualifications.
(iv) Allegation 4. UNEP Staff Member 1 and UNEPIPCAU Consultant
represented UNEP in various seminars and supervised UNEP staff members,
contrary to relevant United Nations rules.
2. The evidence adduced for allegation 1 shows that UNEP Staff Member 2, and
UNEP/PCAU Consultant did not at any time have a financial relationship with the former
company. However, the BTF had a series of contracts and extensions of those contracts
with the former company and UNEP Staff Member 1 was a shareholder and senior officerof the former company and, as a sub-contractor of the former company, worked for the
BTF. During the time UNEP Staff Member 1 held a consultancy contract with UNEP, the
former company had no contractual relationship with UNEP. Although this created the
appearance of a conflict of interest, none was established.
3. The evidence adduced for Allegation 2 does not support the complaint against
UNEP Staff Member 1.
4. The evidence adduced for allegation 3 shows that UNEP Staff Member 2
received an appointment with PCAU in May 2000, about a year after s/he began work for
the BTF as a consultant. Both s/he and UNEP Staff Member 1 subsequently received
high-level contracts. UNEP management advised ID/OIOS that UNEP Staff Member 1
and UNEP Staff Member 2 performed well, which they felt justified their decision to
grant them contracts at the high level, although UNEP Staff Member 1 did not have the
requisite educational background and UNEP Staff Member 2 had little environmental
expertise prior to his consultancy with BTF. This allegation could not be substantiated.
5. Allegation 4 was substantiated. UNEP/PCAU Consultant and UNEP Staff
Member 1 both admitted that they had represented the Organization in various seminars
while consulting for BTF. UNEP Staff Member 1 also supervised UNEP staff members
while a consultant. These actions were a breach of ST/Al/l999/7 II 2 (f), which states
""consultants shall not perform functions of staff members of the Organization or have
any representative or supervisory responsibility."" UNEPlPCAU Consultant continues as a
consultant, but UNEP Staff Member 1 is now a staff member.
6. During the course of the investigation, ID/OIOS learned that the former
company received contracts and extensions of contracts with BTF through UNOPS
without competitive bidding, in violation of Financial Regulation 1.2 which states that
""Procurement functions include all actions necessary for the acquisition, by purchase or
lease, of property, including products and real property, and of services, including works.
The following general principles shall be given due consideration when exercising the
procurement functions of the United Nations: (a) Best value for money; (6) fairness,
integrity and transparency; (c) Effective international competition; (d) The interest of the
United Nations.""
7. In conclusion, ID/OIOS finds that UNEP and UNOPS departed from United
Nations rules and regulations as described above. These irregularities seem not to have
been carried out in bad faith because the urgency of the situation necessitated that BTF
become operational rapidly. However, once operational, both Organizations should have
taken measures to rectify the problems identified in the allegations.
8. Should you require further information on this matter, please contact
Mr. Francis Montil, Deputy-Director, ID/OIOS at 431-260-60-5420.
9. The favour of a response by 22 May 2005 would be appreciated.","[('United Nations Nations Unies\n', 'ORG'), ('Klaus Toepfer', 'PERSON'), ('22 April 2005', 'DATE'), ('United Nations Environment Programme', 'ORG'), ('05-226', 'DATE'), (': Barbara Dixon', 'PERSON'), ('-', 'CARDINAL'), ('the Post-Conflict Assessment Unit\n-\n(PCAU)', 'ORG'), ('the United Nations Environmental Programme', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('The Investigations Division of', 'ORG'), ('the Office of Internal Oversight Services\n', 'ORG'), ('the Balkans Task Force (', 'ORG'), ('the United Nations Environment\nProgramme', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('UNEPIPCAU', 'ORG'), ('BTF', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('fifty percent', 'PERCENT'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('4', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEPIPCAU', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('United Nations', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('BTF', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('4', 'CARDINAL'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('May 2000', 'DATE'), ('about a year', 'DATE'), ('BTF', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('ID/OIOS', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('BTF', 'ORG'), ('4', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('BTF', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('ST', 'GPE'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNEPlPCAU', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('BTF', 'ORG'), ('UNOPS', 'ORG'), ('Financial Regulation 1.2', 'ORG'), ('.\n', 'PRODUCT'), ('the United Nations:', 'ORG'), ('6)', 'DATE'), ('the\nUnited Nations.""', 'ORG'), ('UNEP', 'ORG'), ('UNOPS', 'ORG'), ('United\nNations', 'ORG'), ('BTF', 'ORG'), ('8', 'CARDINAL'), ('Francis Montil', 'PERSON'), ('-', 'CARDINAL'), ('431-260-', 'DATE'), ('60-5420', 'DATE'), ('22 May 2005', 'DATE')]"

Investigation Task Force
Allegations of theft and corruption arising out of the collection of handling and
landing fees and de-icing costs for passenger aircraft using Pristina Airport.
(Case 0283/04)
I. INTRODUCTION
1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28 February 2003 into the financial
statements of Pristina International Airport conducted by the Chartered
Accountants which led to an investigation concerning alleged corruption and
irregularities arising in the course of procurements and contracts at Pristina
International Airport.
2. There are three specific allegations in this report of investigation:
• Employees overcharged commercial flights using Pristina Airport for handling and
landing fees and other services.
• Employees failed to account for the money paid to them in handling and landing
fees and other services.
• Employees requested and /or received corrupt payments in return for allocating
landing slots to airlines at the most convenient times.
II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS
PROCEDURAL RULES
Section 1 of UNMIK Regulation 1999/24 dated 12 December 1999 as amended,
states that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:
a) “The regulations promulgated by the Special Representative of the
Secretary General (SRSG) and subsidiary instruments issued pursuant to
those regulations; and
b) The Law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.”
UN Staff Regulations 1.2 (b) stipulates “Staff members shall uphold the highest
standards of efficiency, competence and integrity”
Staff Rule 110.1: Misconduct. “Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her
obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and the
Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances, or to observe the standards of
conduct expected of an international civil servant, may amount to unsatisfactory
conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2, leading to the institution of
disciplinary measures for misconduct.”2
III. METHODOLOGY
3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on
the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators
conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons
indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by
obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV,
which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.
4. This report details the findings resulting from these enquiries.
IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
5. Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under
Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal
buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period
covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the
Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the
Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution
1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999,
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned
and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.
6. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina
Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,
including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport
and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport
Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left
UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an
international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations,
reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001.
Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from the
armed forces of a United Nations member state, specifically Airport Engineer I,
Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3, and later by the Consultant from the
Consulting Firm.
7. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed
from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional
Manager was appointed at the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under him
were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official.
8. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been
under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under
ICAO regulations.
9. It is against this background of change that procurement procedures relating to
the following contract have been examined.3
V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS
10. This case concerns allegations of corruption by staff at Pristina Airport arising
from handling and landing fees levied on passenger aircraft using the Airport in
the period January – December 2001. The case also deals with allegations of
corruption arising from de-icing costs levied on passenger aircraft using the
Airport during the same period and alleged requests for corrupt payments for the
allocation of landing slots to airlines at the most convenient times.
11. Samples were taken from a total of 21 airlines using the airport at Pristina in
2001. The year 2001 was selected due to the fact that fees appear to have been
collected and receipts issued manually. Therefore, it was assessed that a greater
risk of fraudulent activity existed.
12. Where possible, similar dates and the type of aircraft were selected to allow for a
comparative analysis of landing charges and passenger charges.
13. An average price was then calculated for each type of aircraft by selecting a
sample of landings for each airline and multiplied by the number of flights to give
an estimate of the total income from landing fees.
14. The ITF obtained a price list, dated 1 January 2002, which provides an indication
as to the respective costs for basic airport services, based on the weight of the
aircraft.
Handling Fees and De-icing costs
15. The total income from landing fees in 2001 was estimated at DM 14,357,949
(equivalent to €7,341,163. This compares with a figure of €7,376,182 in the profit
and loss accounts produced by the Chartered Accountants.
16. This result suggests that in the absence of further information, the aircraft
charges agreed with the figures produced in the official accounts of the Airport.
However, the integrity of the information on which the accounts are based cannot
be verified. The possibility therefore remains that airlines were routinely
overcharged.
17. It was noted that there are small variations in the prices charged to different
airlines for the same type of aircraft. However, certain airlines appeared to have
measurably lower costs. These were:
• Airline 1 – Average DM 2190
• Airline 2 – Average DM 2888.
18. The receipts books do not indicate whether Airline 1 carried passengers and if so,
how many.
19. It was notable that where aircraft requested de-icing facilities, this appears to
have added considerably to the landing fees costs.
20. A schedule was created detailing costs associated with de-icing. With the
possible exception of one Airline 3 flight, this does not appear to indicate any4
obvious anomalies, although it again did not take into account the possibility that
airlines were uniformly being overcharged for de-icing.
Landing Fees
21. Passenger taxes appear to be charged at 25 DM per passenger. A spreadsheet
was created detailing the total number of persons travelling in the period 1
February 2001 until 31 December 2001 together with the number of persons not
paying passenger tax. The file did not contain any data for the month of January
2001.
22. The spreadsheet produced by the ITF indicated a total of 375,472 passengers
during the relevant period, of whom, 18,996 did not pay the required passenger
tax. If this number is multiplied by 25 DM and converted to Euro per paying
passenger, this gives a total of €4,799,395 as against a stated income figure in
the accounts of €4,919,190 for the whole year. This gap is diminished if a number
of passengers were to be added for the month of January 2001.
23. However, there remains a possibility that the passengers were not being charged
airport tax when they should have been, or that the sums detailed in the accounts
do not equate with sums actually paid.
24. In an effort to verify whether or not airlines were being routinely overcharged for
handling and landing fees or de-icing costs, the ITF sent a request to IATA to
provide information from Airline 3, Airline 4, Airline 5 and Airline 6 concerning any
instances of overcharging or extortion of money by staff at Pristina Airport. The
request also sought information concerning any instances of corruption arising
from the allocation of landing slots at Pristina Airport.
25. Regrettably, to date, no substantive response has been received from the airlines
or IATA.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
26. Whilst the figures for handling and landing fees broadly agree with the figures
produced in the accounts of the Airport, it is not possible to ascertain whether the
source of information forming the basis of the accounts is reliable.
27. In the absence of cooperation from the Airlines and IATA, despite repeated
requests by the ITF, it is not possible to progress the case further.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
28. It is therefore recommended that based on the results of this investigation,
UNMIK should prepare an official request to the above-mentioned airlines in an
effort to obtain their support and any information relevant to this matter.

Alleged Violations of Procurement Procedures Insurance (No. 0216104)
SUBJECT:
OBJET:
1. In April 2004, the Investigation Task Force (ITF) received information alleging
possible violations of UNMUK procurement procedures involving the purchase of
insurance cover for the Pristina Airport commencing as of 1 April 2004,
2. This insurance was obtained by UNMIK with the assistance of the Icelandic Civil
Aviation Administration (ICAA). An agreement between UNMIK and the ICAA
of 1 April 2004 specified the procedures as follows:
""UNMIK shall, with the assistance of Iceland as described in WPVI-I of
Schedule VI, f i requested, obtain and maintain appropriate insurances for
the airport, its equipment, facilities, operations, and sewices from
reputable insurers. UNMIK shall, as and when reasonably required by
Iceland, provide Iceland with satisfactoy evidence o f such insurance.
-
WPV 1 1 reads:
Y' CAA will provide assistance in acquiring liability insurance t.,t cover the
operation at Pristina Airport. The ICAA will use results from similar
activities for acquiring liability insurancef or Icelandic Airports (. .. ). Most
of the activities will be performed in Iceland (...).
""
3. The insurance coverage arranged by ICAA commenced on 1 April 2004;
however, previously obtained insurance policy for the airport - for the time-frame
-
prior to 1 April 2004 was not cancelled.
4. The ITF inquired with staff at Pristina Airport dealing with insurance issues, and
analyzed correspondence between these staff members and ICAA representatives.
The documentation identified that the reason for double-coverage was the lack of
a detailed insurance policy for the new coverage. KTA and Airport
representatives had contacted ICAA several times for such policy documents and
felt uncomfortable canceling the old policy without comprehensive information
about the new one.
5. Further, in interviews with the ITF, the Airport personnel did not know whether
the ICAA was required to follow UNMIK procurement protocols. However, a
KTA Internal Audit Department staff member confirmed that no breaches of KTA
rules, UNMIK procurement rules, or the above-mentioned agreement could beidentified in the purchase of the new policy through the ICAA. The ITF hrther
concludes that UNMIK procurement rules were not applicable to the ICAA as the
agreement between UNMIK and the ICAA (for the government of Iceland) is
prevailing and does not identify such a requirement.
6. There is also no evidence of improper collusion or negotiations during the
requisitioning process of the insurance policy, nor is no evidence that the process
was corrupted.
7. Finally, the ITF can report that comprehensive policy documents have been
provided by the ICAA and the previous insurance policy has been cancelled.
8. If you have any questions or comments regarding this report, please do not

Subject: Alleged misappropriation of funds – Manager
Object: (Case No. 050/04)
1. The Investigation Task Force (ITF) has been investigating an allegation regarding
administrative irregularities regarding the insurance coverage for Pristina Airport
by a London-based Company, who then purchased the cover from Insurance
Company 1 between 2001 and 2003.
2. Based on extensive documentation obtained from UNMIK Pillar II, the Kosovo
Trust Agency (KTA) and Public Enterprise Airport Pristina (PEAP), the ITF
determined that the responsible Manager did not undertake efforts in 2002 or
2003 to invite international tenders for the Airport’s insurance coverage.
According to UNMIK regulations 1999/2 – Finance Administration Instruction on
Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Funds – and in view of the cost
of the premiums of more than $125,000 USD, such a tender should have been
undertaken. The Manager did not prepare an international tender for at least the
period 2 October 2003 to 1 October 2004, instead, he concluded a contract in
favour of Insurance Company 1 effecting insurance coverage pertaining to
Pristina International Airport for a further year. It should be considered as to
whether this conduct demonstrates probable cause with regard to the waste or
misappropriation of public funds. Such an issue should be determined by a review
of the matter by the Department of Justice.
3. The ITF investigation also adduced evidence of double insurance coverage at
Pristina International Airport. On 1 April 2004, an Icelandic Civil Aviation
Administration (ICAA) assumed the responsibility to ensure air safety at Pristina
Page 1 of 2International Airport and established new insurance coverage package for aviation
liability guaranteed by Insurance Company 2. That task was undertaken at the
request of UNMIK.
4. The Manager had direct contact with the above-mentioned Insurance Ccompany 2
for the preparation of the new coverage. Despite the fact that the Airport
insurance coverage by London-based Company/Insurance Company 1 was valid
until 2 October 2004, the insurance coverage arranged by UNMIK and the
Insurance Company 2 commenced on 1 April 2004 and included the same
insurance substance, but with even higher sums insured and several small
amendments.
5. The contract with Insurance Company 1 covered the period 2 October 2003 to 1
October 2004. According to the Insurance Company 1 Contract Policy dated 9
July 2002, paragraph 4 of the General Conditions, the “…Policy may be cancelled
at any time at the written request of the Insured … provided 30 days notice …”.
The Manager would appear to have ignored that fact. The airport therefore had
two insurance packages for the period 1 April to 1 October 2004. The financial
loss for Pristina International Airport arises from this duplicate insurance
coverage.
6. ITF investigators have conducted three administrative interviews, including of the
suspect. As a result of these interviews, the ITF believes there is a prima facie
case against the Manager for offence(s) against the Provisional Criminal
Procedure Code of Kosovo.
7. The ITF, by this memorandum, advises you of our preliminary findings and seeks
your approval for the matter to be forwarded to the Department of Justice for
appropriate judicial review. The ITF file will be made available to the Department
of Justice for the purposes of that review and any future judicial investigation.
8. Any questions or comments on the above information should be addressed to Mr
Wolfgang Nikolaus, Head, ITF (ext. 3896) in Pristina, or Mr Mark Gough,

INVESTIGATION TASK FORCE
Investigation into Allegations of Bribery and Favouritism in Procurement of Uniforms
by Pristina Airport
(ITF Case No. 0462/04)
I. Background and Allegations
1. A Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) Internal Audit Unit (IAU) Internal Memorandum dated 4
October 2004, which described the audit of the procurement of staff uniforms by Pristina
Airport, raised concerns as to the reasoning for the cancellation of a competitive tender
for summer and winter uniforms (Pristina Airport Reference No. PEAP/CG/UAS/19/05/04)
and the subsequent issue of a single source contract for summer uniforms for new staff
(Pristina Airport Reference No. SHKTA/CG/16-04).
2. In the IAU memo, reference is made to a letter of complaint dated 28-06-04 from Vendor
1, a company that competed for the tender and that was subsequently awarded the single
source contract to supply summer uniforms. The author of the letter, Vendor 1 Manager,
alleged the existence of rumours and witnesses in the matter of the bribery of
Procurement Officer 1, Pristina Airport, and the Finance Officer, Pristina Airport, by one of
Vendor 1 Manager’s competitors in the tender process, Vendor 2. Vendor 1 Manager’s
letter also identified his intention to seek legal action against Procurement Officer 1 for
allegedly violating “the procurement rules” by: replacing a member of the Bid Evaluation
Committee in the competitive tender; allowing a member of the Finance Department, the
Finance Officer, to sit on the committee; and favouring Vendor 2 in the tender process.
3. During the course of the investigation, Procurement Officer 1 told the ITF that, following
the cancellation of the competitive tender, Vendor 1 Manager had made utterances to
him/her that Procurement Officer 1 had interpreted as a threat.
4. The ITF commenced an inquiry into the allegations regarding the procurement process
and now provides a summary of the case and its findings and recommendations.
II. Applicable Law
5. The law applicable to each of the allegations is detailed below.

Allegation 5: that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Officer 1
Provisional Criminal Code of Kosovo – Article 161 “Threat”
III. Investigation Details
6. Procurement Officer 1 managed the competitive tender for the supply of uniforms. In
addition to Vendor 1, Vendor 2 and Vendor 3 submitted bids following which Procurement
Officer 1 convened and chaired a Bid Opening Committee on 10-06-04. Present, in
addition to the committee that comprised members of the various airport work groups,
were representatives of the three bidding companies including Vendor 1 Manager.
7. Procurement Officer 1 also formed and chaired a Bid Evaluation Committee to assess the
offerings of the competitors, which comprised a range of uniforms and accessories for the
various categories of airport employees. On 18-06-04, the committee, though not satisfied
with all Vendor 2’s samples, tentatively decided in favour of that company, the median
bidder in terms of price (Vendor 1 was the highest bidder). The committee resolved that
Vendor 2 would be approached to determine the feasibility of no-cost design changes to
one of the uniforms for women employees. The committee reconvened on 23-06-04 at the
request of Pristina Airport Official. During the meeting, Pristina Airport Official announced
the cancellation of the tender. Pristina Airport Official later awarded a single-source
procurement contract for summer uniforms for newly hired staff, in the amount of
€106,059, to Vendor 1, which had supplied uniforms to the airport under two previous
contracts.
Allegation 1: that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer accepted bribes from Vendor
2
8. When asked by the ITF to substantiate his/her allegation that Procurement Officer 1 and
the Finance Officer had accepted bribes from Vendor 2, Vendor 1 Manager said that
he/she had heard the rumours in Pristina coffee bars but that he/she could not remember
from whom he/she had heard these rumours. He/she said that the witnesses to whom
he/she had referred in his letter of complaint were actually the same persons from whom
he/she heard the rumours. Vendor 1 Manager was unable to suggest which
representative of Vendor 2 had paid the bribes.
9. Vendor 2 Employee who attended the meeting of the Bid Opening Committee; Vendor 2
Manager; and Vendor 2 Director all told ITF that they had not paid bribes to Procurement
Officer 1 and/or the Finance Officer.
10. Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer both denied accepting bribes or any other
consideration from any person in this matter.
Allegation 2: that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of the Bid Evaluation Committee
11. Procurement Officer 1 explained to the ITF that the original nominee to the committee,
Committee member 1, had not been at work on the day that the committee first convened
and, therefore, had been replaced by Committee member 2, who then attended the
second session for continuity purposes. Committee member 1 and Committee member 2
confirmed Procurement Officer 1’s explanation for the replacement.
2Allegation 3: that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately included the Finance Officer in the Bid
Evaluation Committee
12. The Finance Officer, Procurement Officer 1 and Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that
the Finance Officer participated on the Bid Evaluation Committee. However, Procurement
Officer 1 and Pristina Airport Official each said that the other had nominated the Finance
Officer to the committee. KTA legal staff advised the ITF that the wisdom of allowing a
representative of the Finance Department to participate in bid evaluations is questionable
because, generally, officers whose function involves payment should not evaluate
contractors to whom payment will become due. According to KTA legal staff, however,
such participation is not precluded by any rule or law. Section 23.9.2 of Finance
Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revised 15 December 1999) – Public Procurement
Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds precludes only an “approving officer” from the
Procuring Entity who will eventually sign a contract from serving as a tender evaluator.
The Finance Officer was not an “approving officer” in this procurement process and,
therefore, was not prevented from serving as an evaluator.
Allegation 4: that Procurement Officer 1 favoured Vendor 2 in the tender process
13. In addition to Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer, Bid Evaluation Committee
members Committee member 3, Committee member 4, Committee member 5,
Committee member 6, Committee member 2, and Committee member 7 told the ITF that
the conduct of the committee was completely fair and proper. (Committee member 4 told
the ITF that he/she attended the first session of the Bid Evaluation Committee but that
he/she missed the second session because of the illness of his son.) The general
consensus of the committee was that Vendor 2’s samples were better overall in terms of
quality and design but the committee was not completely satisfied with Vendor 2’s goods.
However, Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that the committee was divided during the
second session, with one group preferring Vendor 2’s goods and the other preferring
those of Vendor 1. Pristina Airport Official said that Procurement Officer 1 (who, as
committee chair, did not have the right to vote) and the Finance Officer argued in favour
of Vendor 2. None of the committee members supported Pristina Airport Official’s
assertions in this regard.
14. The ITF allowed Pristina Airport Official to review a copy of the Bid Evaluation Committee
report prepared by Procurement Officer 1, the last page of which listed the attendees at
the session of the Bid Opening Committee (Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance
Officer were the only members of the Bid Opening Committee who also served on the Bid
Evaluation Committee). Upon looking at the attendee list of the Bid Opening Committee,
Pristina Airport Official named the committee members who, he/she said, had Vendor 1’s
and Vendor 2’s samples respectively. He/she correctly identified Procurement Officer 1
and the Finance Officer but the other four persons whom he/she named were members of
the Bid Opening Committee, not the Bid Evaluation Committee. Pristina Airport Official’s
mistaken identification of these persons as Bid Evaluation Committee members indicates
that his memory of the events of the second committee meeting might be unclear.
15. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that he/she believed that had he/she not cancelled the
competitive tender, the Bid Evaluation Committee would have awarded the contract to
Vendor 2. Pristina Airport Official said that he/she believed that Procurement Officer 1
had been “primed” to award the contract to Vendor 2 because Procurement Officer 1 had
expressed a preference for and argued in support of Vendor 2’s” inferior product and
because a source (whose identity Pristina Airport Official was unable to recall) had told
him/her that Procurement Officer 1 had been driven to the airport on several occasions by
a person in either the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of Transportation who was
associated with Vendor 2. Pristina Airport Official said that he/she cancelled the
competitive tender for these reasons. He/she said that he/she did not voice his suspicions
during the committee meeting, adding that he/she did not subsequently report his
suspicions because “priming” is common and if he/she reported every instance he/she
would not have time to do his job. He/she said that proving that Procurement Officer 1
had “pushed” one competitor would have been difficult.
16. Procurement Officer 1 told the ITF that a former Kosovo Minister is his godfather. He/she
said that he/she has never received a ride to the airport from the Former Kosovo Minister
3or in his car. He/she said that he/she has no idea whether the Former Kosovo Minister is
in any way associated with Vendor 2. He/she said that neither the Former Kosovo
Minister nor any other person pressured him/her to show favouritism to Vendor 2.
17. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that he/she had not seen Vendor 1 Manager’s letter of
complaint and had never heard of Vendor 1 Manager’s allegation regarding the bribery of
Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer. However, Pristina Airport Official’s
administrative assistant said that he/she had been present when Vendor 1 Manager
voiced his suspicion to Pristina Airport Official that an individual from the airport had
accepted bribes. Pristina Airport Official’ administrative assistant said that he/she could
not recall to whom Vendor 1 Manager referred. In addition, he/she told the ITF that
Vendor 1 Manager had given him/her his letter of complaint. Pristina Airport Official’s
administrative assistant said that he/she does not recall whether he/she handed the letter
to Pristina Airport Official or left it for his attention and he/she does not recall Pristina
Airport Official mentioning the letter.
18. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that, following the cancellation of the competitive
tender, his only alternative to obtain uniforms for newly hired staff was to award a contract
to Vendor 1, who had supplied the airport for the past two years. He/she said that had
he/she let a new tender for summer uniforms, the uniforms would not have been ready
until the end of August (2004).
19. ITF allowed Pristina Airport Official to read a copy of a memo dated 30-06-04 to him/her
from Procurement Officer 1 that described the events of the tender process and
summarized the reasons for its cancellation. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that,
although he/she had signed the memo, he/she had not “really read” it previously. The
articulated reasons for the cancellation are listed below. Pristina Airport Official and
Procurement Officer 1 said that they had contributed to the list of reasons but disagreed
over which of the reasons had been provided by whom, however, they both said that
Pristina Airport Official had provided the term “unsatisfactory quality”.
i) unsatisfactory quality
ii) unsatisfactory design
iii) evaluation committee not satisfied with the uniforms
iv) no manufacturing details were given
v) documents not completed
20. Procurement Officer 2 told the ITF that he/she transmitted several documents regarding
the single-source procurement of summer uniforms to KTA. Included in the document
package was a Procurement Memo dated 07-07-04 signed by Pristina Airport Official and,
according to Procurement Officer 2, prepared by Pristina Airport Official. (Pristina Airport
Official told the ITF that he/she believes that he/she wrote the justification.) The
justification segment of the memo stated that uniforms would be obtained by single-
source procurement from the current supplier (Vendor 1) for reasons of good quality and
durability.
21. The ITF pointed out to Pristina Airport Official that he/she had referred to the same
uniforms as being of “unsatisfactory quality” and “good quality” in the respective
documents. He/she then admitted “flowering up” his memo and providing embellishment
to ensure that KTA would approve the procurement. He/she said that the term
“unsatisfactory quality” in the memo dated 30-06-04 was poorly chosen and that the
quality of Vendor 1’s uniforms actually met the airport’s requirements. However, he/she
said that the design of the uniforms design was “basic and poor.”
Allegation 5: that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Officer 1
22. Procurement Officer 1 told the ITF that, on a day (he/she could not specify the date)
following the second meeting of the Bid Evaluation Committee at which the decision was
taken to cancel the competitive tender, Vendor 1 Manager entered Procurement Officer
1’s office and, in the presence of Procurement Officer 2 and a Pristina Airport Civil
Engineer made utterances that Procurement Officer 1 interpreted as a threat. According
to Procurement Officer 1, Vendor 1 Manager said that he/she would meet Procurement
Officer 1 outside; that, because he/she had cancelled the tender, Procurement Officer 1
4would find out who Vendor 1 Manager was; and that Procurement Officer 1 would see
what he/she had done by canceling the tender.
23. Procurement Officer 2 assistant confirmed that he/she had been present during the
incident but he/she had paid only partial attention to what transpired. He/She said that
Vendor 1 Manager might have mentioned that Procurement Officer 1 would have to deal
with KTA Internal Audit and the Investigation Task Force. The Civil Engineer also
confirmed his presence and said that he/she could recall Vendor 1 Manager saying
something to the effect of “You have to see who I am.” The Civil Engineer said that
he/she interpreted the words to mean that Procurement Officer 1 should be afraid of
Vendor 1 Manager.
24. Vendor 1 Manager confirmed that an incident had occurred between him/her and
Procurement Officer 1. Vendor 1 Manager said that he/she told Procurement Officer 1
that he/she was the main reason for the cancellation of the tender and that he/she told
Procurement Officer 1 “You’ll see what you have done. You’ll see that I’ll go to the highest
levels and if necessary, I’ll see you in court.” Vendor 1 Manager said that he/she did not
ask Procurement Officer 1 to go outside with him/her, that he/she did not threaten
Procurement Officer 1 and did not imply that he/she would commit physical aggression.
IV. Findings of Fact
Allegation 1: that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer accepted bribes from Vendor
2
25. The ITF did not find any evidence to support the allegation that Procurement Officer 1
and/or the Finance Officer accepted bribes from Vendor 2 in this matter. Moreover, the
ITF did not find evidence that any person received a bribe or other compensation or a
promise of a bribe or other compensation in relation to either the competitive tender or the
single-source procurement. Therefore, the allegation of bribery is considered to be
unsubstantiated.
Allegation 2: that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of the Bid Evaluation Committee
26. The rationale for replacing the member of the Bid Evaluation Committee is reasonable.
Furthermore, Vendor 1 Manager did not intimate that the replacement was made for any
questionable purpose. Therefore, the allegation is considered to be correct but the
substantive act is not considered to have been based on ulterior motives.
Allegation 3: that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately placed the Finance Officer on the Bid
Evaluation Committee
27. The ITF established that the Finance Officer participated on the committee but did not
determine whether he/she was nominated by Procurement Officer 1 or Pristina Airport
Official. Regardless, the ITF did not identify any indication that The Finance Officer’s
behaviour on the committee was in any way unprofessional or improper. In the absence
of specific regulations precluding the participation of finance personnel in such processes,
this allegation is considered to be unsubstantiated.
Allegation 4: that Procurement Officer 1 favoured Vendor 2 in the tender process
28. The ITF did not find any evidence to support the allegation that Procurement Officer 1 had
favoured Vendor 2 during the tender process. Similarly, Pristina Airport Official’s opinion
that Procurement Officer 1 had been “primed” to select Vendor 2 is unsubstantiated. The
credibility of Pristina Airport Official’s portrayal of Procurement Officer 1 as a strong
proponent of Vendor 2 in a divided committee was contradicted by the committee
members themselves and undermined by Pristina Airport Official’s misidentification of
most of the members. Procurement Officer 1’s management of the proceedings appears
to have been fair and objective based on the assertions of the members of the Bid
Evaluation Committee. Therefore, this allegation is considered to be unsubstantiated.
Allegation 5: that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Officer 1
529. The ITF was unable to substantiate that Vendor 1 Manager’s utterances constituted a
threat against Procurement Officer 1.
V. Recommendations
30. The ITF offers the following recommendations:
Recommendation No. 1: It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV inform Procurement Officer 1
and the Finance Officer, as well as the KTA Internal Audit Unit, that the ITF did not find any
wrongdoing on the part of Procurement Officer 1 or the Finance Officer. (IV04/462/01)
Recommendation No. 2: It is recommended that UNMIK provide this report to both the
Department of Justice and the Financial Investigation Unit for information purposes, so as to

Investigation Task Force
Investigation into allegations of irregularities in two tender processes for the
supply of cleaning machines to Pristina Airport. (Case 0280/04)
I. INTRODUCTION
1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28 February 2003 into the financial
statements of Pristina International Airport conducted by the Chartered
Accountants which led to an investigation concerning alleged corruption and
irregularities arising in the course of procurements and contracts at Pristina
International Airport.
2. There are two specific allegations in this report of investigation:
• no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by
companies submitting bids in the first tender;
• tender specifications for both tenders the cleaning machines were taken from the
brochure of one of the companies submitting a tender, thereby giving it an unfair
advantage in the tender process.
II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS
PROCEDURAL RULES
Section 1 of UNMIK Regulation 1999/24 dated 12 December 1999 as amended,
states that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:
a) “The regulations promulgated by the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General (SRSG) and subsidiary instruments issued pursuant to
those regulations; and
b) The Law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.”
UN Staff Regulations 1.2 (b) stipulates “Staff members shall uphold the highest
standards of efficiency, competence and integrity”
UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using
Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds provides that:
Article 4 1 – “Competition among and participation in the procurement process
shall be maximised.”
Article 4.1.1 – “All Suppliers and Contractors and their tenders shall be treated
fairly, equally, and non-discriminatorily, without favouritism or prejudice and each
Tender shall be judged on its merits.”
Article 4.3.3. – “If a consultant or any principal, officer or employee of such
consultant has participated or will participate in any manner in the preparation of2
the UNMIK Kosovo Interim Administration’s Tendering for a contract, including
but not limited to preparations of specifications or any other Tender Documents,
no such consultant nor any principal officer or employee of such consultant, no
“related person” nor any “illegal payer” may tender for or sponsor or participate in
the Tendering for such contract.”
Article 15 1 – “Technical specifications and descriptions of the Goods, Works, or
Services to be procured shall be carefully prepared to foster fair and open
competition among all suppliers.”
Article 15.4 – “There shall be no requirements or reference in the technical
specifications to a particular trademark, brand name, patent, design, type, origin,
producer or service provider unless (a) there is no sufficiently precise or
intelligible way of describing the procurement requirements and (b) qualifying
words, such as “or equivalent” are included in such requirement or reference.”
Staff Rule 110.1: Misconduct. “Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her
obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and the
Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances, or to observe the standards of
conduct expected of an international civil servant, may amount to unsatisfactory
conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2, leading to the institution of
disciplinary measures for misconduct.”
I. METHODOLOGY
3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on
the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators
conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons
indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by
obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV,
which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.
II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
4. Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under
Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal
buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period
covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the
Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the
Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution
1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999.
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned
and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.
5. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina
Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,
including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport
and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport
Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left
UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an3
international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations,
reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001.
Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from the
armed forces of a United Nations member state, specifically Airport Engineer 1,
Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3 and later by the Consultant from the
Consulting Firm.
6. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed
from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional
Manager was appointed to the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under him
were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official 1.
7. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been
under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under
ICAO regulations.
8. It is against this background of change that procurement procedures relating to
the following contract have been examined.
III. INVESTIGATION DETAILS
9. This part of the investigation relates to two tenders for a contract, for the supply
of cleaning machines at Pristina Airport. The value of the contract was
€180,816.00.
Allegation 1
(It is alleged that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due to the fact that no
proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by
companies submitting bids in the first tender)
10. A bid evaluation report drawn up by the Procurement Officer, dated 18 April
2003, identifies that bids were opened in an evaluation process to select a
company to supply cleaning machines to Pristina Airport on 18 April 2003.
However, a notification letter from the PEAP Official and the KTA Divisional
Manager to the companies participating in the tender exercise dated 6 June 2003
confirms that this tender was cancelled.
11. When asked about the reason for the cancellation, the Procurement Officer 1
stated to the ITF that the technical specifications for the first tender were taken
from a catalogue of a certain producer, which offered those machines, as a result
of which it predetermined the winner. He/she added that machinery specified was
of the most expensive type. (See below allegation 2)
12. The Maintenance Official and Member of the Evaluation Committee, when asked
the same question, stated that the first tender was cancelled due to the fact that
the Procurement Officer 1 indicated there had been no proper description of the
cabins for the cleaning machines in the bids submitted. However, he/she added
that from his/her knowledge at least two of the companies had included a proper
description of the cabins in their bid documents.4
13. An Engineer at the Pristina Airport, told the ITF that the Airport requested
cleaning machines with cabins in order that cleaning could be carried out in
different weather conditions. However, the bidders did not include the cabin in
their bids. He/she did not indicate that two bidders included a proper description
in their bid documents.
14. In the light of the evidence provided, and detailed below, the ITF does not find
that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due to the fact that no proper
description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by companies
submitting bids in the first tender.
Allegation 2
First tender
(It is alleged that tender specifications for both tenders the cleaning machines were
taken from the brochure of one of the companies submitting a tender, thereby giving
it an unfair advantage in the tender process)
15. The person responsible for drawing up the specifications for the both tenders was
the Engineer at the Pristina Airport, who confirmed in interview that he/she had
been asked to draw up the specifications by the Member of the Evaluation
Committee. He/she also confirmed that the Member of the Evaluation Committee
provided him with signed photocopies from the brochure of Vendor 1 in order to
assist him in drawing up the specifications. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport
added that he/she used them as a basis for the technical specifications. The ITF
located a draft of an undated handwritten note from the Engineer at the Pristina
Airport to the KTA Divisional Manager, which confirms that he/she used the
photocopies from the brochure to assist him in drawing up the technical
specifications for the cleaning machines. The Member of the Evaluation
Committee confirmed to the ITF that he/she handed the signed pages to the
Engineer at the Pristina Airport to assist in the preparation of the technical
specifications for the cleaning machines.
16. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport and the Member of the Evaluation Committee
were asked in interview whether they were aware of the provision of Article 15 of
Financial Administration Instruction No. 2/1999, and in particular Articles 15.1 and
15.4. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport indicated that he/she worked on the
general principle set out in Article 15.1, but had not seen Article 15.4; whilst the
Chairman of the Evaluation Committee appeared to be ignorant of Article 15
altogether.
Second tender
17. A bid evaluation report dated 30 June 2003 indicates that a second tender
exercise was undertaken following the cancellation of the first one.
18. Pristina Airport Procurement Officer 2 in the second tender indicated that
although Procurement Officer 1 published the tender, Procurement Officer 2 did
the bid opening and was the Member of the Evaluation Committee. This is
confirmed in a memorandum from Procurement Officer 2 to the PEAP Official5
dated 9 July 2003, which identifies the evaluation committee members and in an
ITF interview with Procurement Officer 2, the PEAP Official did not refer to
Procurement Officer 2 or the second tender evaluation committee in his/her
interview.
19. Procurement Officer 2 added that the evaluation committee chose Vendor 2.
However, after he/she had drafted the contract and letter of acceptance for
signature, he/she was instructed by the Airport management, although he/she did
not state by whom, to put it on hold until the technical evaluation committee and
airport management had organised a meeting with the Procurement Officer 1.
20. According to Procurement Officer 2, the reason for the meeting was due to
concerns that the winning bid was the second most expensive and doubts that
the technical specifications had given an unfair advantage to one company.
21. An examination of the technical evaluation report and Vendor 2’s bid
documentation suggests that the specification produced by Vendor 2 was very
similar to the specification requirement, although there is no evidence that it was
provided with the technical specifications in advance. In addition, Vendor 1, the
company from whose brochure the specifications were taken, did not submit a
bid.
22. An Internet search indicates Vendor 1 is the second largest producer of industrial
cleaning machines in one United Nations member state being founded in 1966. It
went into insolvency in 2002 and was bought by a multi-national company. An
Internet search of its directors does not indicate any connection with Vendor 2.
There is also no indication that Vendor 2 is connected to the multi-national
company.
23. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport, in interview with the ITF, also stated that the
evaluation committee had raised doubts as to whether it would be worthwhile
purchasing the cleaning machines, which whilst meeting the specification criteria,
came at a high price.
IV. FINDINGS OF FACT
24. The first tender for cleaning machines was cancelled due to alleged deficiencies
in the description of the cabins for the cleaning machines in the bids submitted
and the fact that a brochure from the Vendor 1 was used in the preparation of the
technical specifications for the cleaning machines. This gave rise to concerns that
the technical specifications had given an unfair advantage to one company,
namely Vendor 1.
25. The second tender was not awarded due to concerns that the technical
specifications produced from the brochure of Vendor 1 had given an unfair
advantage to one company; and doubts as to the high purchase cost of the
cleaning machines which met the specification criteria.6
V. CONCLUSIONS
26. On the available information, the decision leading to the cancellation of the first
tender was correct, since concerns had been raised concerning both the
descriptions of the machines to be purchased and the fact that a brochure from
Vendor 1 was used in the preparation of the technical specifications for the
cleaning machines. This gave rise to concerns that the technical specifications
had given an unfair advantage to one company in breach of Article 15.1 of
UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using
Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds.
27. The reasons for the second tender not proceeding appear to be well founded if
concerns were expressed over the offer price and the technical specification.
However, there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether in this instance, the
use of technical specifications from a particular company brochure was a
deliberate attempt to corrupt the tender process or due to ignorance of the
regulations.
VI. RECOMMENDATION
28. Based on the above information, the ITF recommends that UNMIK refer this
report to the D/SRSG Pillar IV for any action deemed appropriate with regard to
ensuring that staff involved in preparing tenders do not utilise technical
specifications that would give an unfair advantage to individual companies in the
course of subsequent tender exercises (IV04/280/01).","[('UNITED NATIONS NATIONS UNIES\nUnited Nations Interim Mission d’Administration Intérimaire\nAdministration Mission', 'ORG'), ('Kosovo', 'GPE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Pristina Airport', 'FAC'), ('28 February 2003', 'DATE'), ('Pristina International Airport', 'FAC'), ('the Chartered\nAccountants', 'ORG'), ('Pristina\nInternational Airport', 'FAC'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), (':', 'CARDINAL'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNITED NATIONS\nPROCEDURAL', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('12 December 1999', 'DATE'), ('Kosovo', 'GPE'), ('the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General (SRSG)', 'ORG'), ('The Law', 'DATE'), ('Kosovo', 'GPE'), ('22 March 1989', 'DATE'), (')', 'CARDINAL'), ('Public Procurement', 'ORG'), (':', 'CARDINAL'), ('4 1 –', 'DATE'), ('non-', 'ORG'), ('the United Nations', 'ORG'), ('the Investigation Task Force.

Investigation Task Force
Irregularities in the procurement and contract award for Winter and Summer
Uniforms at Pristina Airport (Case 0275/04)
I. INTRODUCTION
1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28 February 2003 into the financial
statements of Pristina International Airport conducted by the Chartered
Accountants, which led to an investigation concerning alleged corruption and
irregularities arising in the course of procurements and contracts at Pristina
International Airport.
2. There are seven specific allegations addressed in this report of investigation:
• the highest bid received for the winter uniforms was accepted;
• there was insufficient information on the bid evaluation sheets for the winter
and summer uniforms tender exercises;
• capital expenditure approval for the winter uniforms contract was signed on 10
January 2003, after the contract had commenced;
• the value of the contract for summer uniforms was irregularly set at €3 below
the limit requiring a competitive tender;
• two companies were invited to tender for the summer uniforms contract when
the evaluation report for the winter uniforms indicated that Vendor 1 could not
offer the quality of uniforms required and Vendor 2 produced an incomplete
offer
• the invitations to quote for summer uniforms sent out to the companies
contained differing quantities of items.
• two further small quantities of uniforms in the sums of €792 and €1,188 were
purchased without any supporting documents or justification.

III. METHODOLOGY
2. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on
the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators
conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by conducting interviews with all
relevant persons; obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration
and from the Pillar IV administration, which were then analysed for relevance to
the inquiry at hand.
IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
3. Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under
Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal
buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period
covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the
Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the
Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution
1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999.
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned
and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.
4. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina
Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,
2including Official 1 and Official 2 Department of Transport and Infrastructure
(DOTI) Official 1 was also involved in the matter. The DOTI was later known as
the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI
Official 1 left UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by
DOTI as an international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport
operations, reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30
September 2001. Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers
seconded from one UN member state’s Army, specifically Airport Engineer 1,
Airport Engineer 2, and Airport Engineer 3, and later by a Consultant from the
Consulting Company.
5. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed
from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional
Manager was appointed. Under him/her were the PEAP Official and Official 3.
6. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been
under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under
ICAO regulations.
7. It is against this background of change that procurement procedures relating to
the following contract have been examined.
V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS
8. This investigation relates to two tenders for contracts for the purchase of winter
and summer uniforms for staff members of Pristina Airport. The value of the
contract for the purchase of winter uniforms was €157,060 and the contract for
the purchase of summer uniforms was €24,997.
Allegations 1 & 2
(It is alleged that the highest bid received for the winter uniforms was accepted,
when it was almost twice the cost of the two further bids received);
and
(It is alleged there was insufficient information on the bid evaluation sheets as to why
the offer from the third company was incomplete)
9. A bid evaluation report dated 6 December 2002 indicates that 8 firms were issued
with documents and 4 bids were submitted. The bids were opened on 27
November 2002. The report indicates at page 3 that Vendor 3’s offer in the sum
of €157,060 was almost twice as much as the other two bids from Vendor 1
(€80,198) and Vendor 2 (€86,850), which were rejected.
10. The reason specified for rejection of the bid by Vendor 1 on page four of the
evaluation was that the evaluation committee asked the company to produce a
specimen of each type of uniform and it failed to do so. This is confirmed in a
letter to Vendor 1 dated 27 November 2002. A similar letter was delivered to
Vendor 3.
11. The evaluation report also concluded that the company Vendor 1 has one
manufacturer in Peja, which can’t offer the required quality and had too long a
date for completion.
312. In the case of Vendor 2, the evaluation report states that the company provided
an incomplete offer.
13. When asked in what manner the offer was incomplete in interview, the
Procurement Officer, a member of the Evaluation Committee, stated that Vendor
2 submitted an offer, which did not contain all the required articles.
14. The Procurement Officer was asked why his/her explanation was not put in the
tender evaluation. He/she replied that it was due to his/her lack of English. In
view of the fact that the evaluation committee all signed the evaluation report,
they would have been aware of the reason for Vendor 2’s rejection.
15. The ITF contacted Vendor 2 and requested it to provide a copy of the tender
documents in order verify whether or not its offer was incomplete. However, the
company did not deliver any documents, or provide any information other than
the name of the person who delivered the documents and samples for the tender
to Pristina Airport. The ITF was therefore unable to verify the Procurement
Officer’s explanation.
16. The explanation in the evaluation report that Vendor 1 produced uniforms which
were of lower quality, together with the explanation given by the Procurement
Officer in interview that Vendor 2 submitted an offer which did not contain all the
required articles, may account in part for the difference in price between the offer
from Vendor 3 and the lower offers from Vendor 2 and Vendor 1. However, the
price difference is of concern.
17. A letter of notification and a signed contract dated 6 December 2002 confirm that
Vendor 3 was awarded the contract for the supply of uniforms to administrative
and maintenance personnel for the winter season.
Allegation 3
(It is alleged that the capital expenditure approval for the winter uniforms contract
was signed on 10 January 2003, after the contract and a letter of notification to the
company had already been signed on 6 December 2002)
18. A capital expenditure approval for the winter uniforms contract appears to have
been signed by the Divisional Manager on 10 January 2003, after a letter of
notification to the company and the contract had already been signed on 6
December 2002.
19. In view of the necessity to have expenditure authorised prior to signature of a
contract, the PEAP Official and the Divisional Manager were asked in interview
why the contract appeared to be signed before the capital expenditure had been
approved.
20. The PEAP Official indicated that although the contract was dated 6 December
2004, the actual date of signature for the contract was the protocol stamp on the
contract, which was 14 January 2003.
21. The Divisional Manager stated that there was no date indicating when the
contract was signed and added that the date on the contract would not
necessarily correspond with the date on which the contract has been signed.
4He/she added that the evidence was not conclusive that the contract had been
signed before capital expenditure approval was obtained.
22. The Divisional Manager added that he/she assumed the protocol stamp date of
14 January 2003 was the date that the contract was returned to the Airport.
23. A better indicator as to the date on which the contract was signed is contained in
a routing slip from the Procurement Officer to Official 4 of Pillar IV, and the KTA
Official dated 13 January 2003. The routing slip states “your signatures are
required before we present the contract to the selected supplier.” This suggests
that the contract may not have been signed until 13 January 2003, (i.e. after
capital expenditure approval had been obtained.)
Allegation 4
(It is alleged that the value of the contract for summer uniforms was irregularly set at
€3 below the limit requiring a competitive tender)
24. On 3 April 2003 an invitation to quote for the supply of uniforms for the summer
season was sent out to 4 companies, of which 3 submitted quotes / bids by the
deadline of 11 April 2003.
25. The offers received were evaluated and Vendor 3 awarded the contract. A
contract was signed by Vendor 3 on 12 April 2003 and countersigned by the
Divisional Manager on 18 April 2003.
26. The offer received from Vendor 3 for the supply of for summer uniforms (€24,997)
was €3 below the maximum limit for competitive shopping. This gives rise to
concerns that the offer was set at a level to avoid the necessity for a competitive
tender.
27. Whilst there is no evidence that this was deliberately done, a second offer was
received from the company Vendor 2 in the sum of €39,541.00. In view of the fact
that the evaluation report indicates that contract to be approximately €25,000 it is
questionable as to whether a competitive tender should have been held rather
than competitive shopping.
Allegation 5
(It is alleged that the companies Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 were invited to tender for
the summer uniforms contract when the evaluation report for the winter uniforms
indicated that Vendor 1 could not offer the quality of uniforms required and Vendor 2
produced an incomplete offer, thereby affording an advantage to the supplier of the
winter uniforms, Vendor 3)
28. The evaluation report and tender documents indicate that two companies Vendor
2 and Vendor 1 were requested to provide competitive bids, in spite of the fact
that some five months earlier, Vendor 2’s previous offer for the winter uniforms
had been rejected by the evaluation committee as incomplete, as it had not
included all the items requested; whilst Vendor 1’s previous offer for the winter
uniforms had been rejected on the basis that it had one manufacturer in Peja
which could not offer the required quality.
29. The opinion of the winter uniforms evaluation committee concerning Vendor 1
was repeated in the findings of the summer uniforms evaluation committee, which
5was indicated by the Procurement Officer to have rejected Vendor 1’s offer on the
grounds that its offer for the uniforms was not responsive from the cut and quality
point of view.
30. The grounds for the two rejections gave rise to concerns that the inclusion of the
two companies in the tender for summer uniforms may have afforded an
advantage to Vendor 3, the eventual winner. Having analysed the available
evidence and carried out research into the two companies, the selection of
Vendor 2 appears to have been justified in view of its size and reputation in the
region, although doubts about the Vendor 1’s suitability to participate in the
summer competitive shopping exercise remain.
31. The Procurement Officer, a member of the evaluation committee, stated in the
course of his/her interview that the companies were invited by one of the PEAP
secretaries Secretary 1 or Secretary 2.
32. The PEAP Official also indicated that the worker who took delivery of the summer
uniforms was Secretary 2.
33. Due to Secretary 2’s possible connection with another more serious criminal
case, involving alleged payments of money in return for jobs at Pristina Airport,
(ITF Case 0377/04) a decision was taken by the ITF not to interview Secretary 2
concerning the choice of companies invited to submit bids in the competitive
shopping procedure, in order to avoid any possible prejudice to the more serious
case.
34. A decision was also taken not to interview Vendor 3 representative, concerning
this case due to the fact that he/she was one of the principal suspects in the
same criminal case.
35. Whilst there are some doubts as to the inclusion of Vendor 1, the selection of
Vendor 2 appears to have been justified in view of its size and reputation in the
region. In view of this, the ITF does not find that the competitive shopping
procedure was organised in such a manner as to provide an unfair advantage to
the existing supplier Vendor 3.
Allegation 6
(It is alleged that the invitations to quote for summer uniforms sent out to the
companies contained differing quantities of items)
36. The two invitations to quote for summer uniforms submitted by the companies
Vendor 3 and Vendor 1 contain different quantities of items from that submitted
by the company Vendor 2. Whilst it is accepted that the price of the offer received
from Vendor 2 was much higher than the other two, it raised a question as to
whether different quantities of items may have been sent to competing
companies.
37. When asked about the differences in the quantities of items, the Procurement
Officer stated that the quantities were changed and revised documents sent out
to all the companies before the deadline to submit the offers had ended. He/she
added that the Airport, as the procuring entity had the right to do so. In view of
this response, the company Vendor 2 was not interviewed.
6Allegation 7
(It is alleged that two further small quantities of uniforms in the sums of €792 and
€1,188 were purchased without any supporting documents or justification)
38. Two invoices dated 4 July 2003 and 5 August 2003 indicate that two quantities of
99 and 66 T-Shirts respectively were ordered with a value of €1188 and €792
respectively.
39. When asked about these extra purchases, the PEAP Official stated that he/she
assumed the Airport hired some students and temporary staff for three months
and that the T-Shirts were for them to wear. The PEAP Official subsequently
produced two written requests from the Security Official, for the two orders dated
1 July 2003 and 1 August 2003.
40. When asked why two orders were placed within one month of one another, rather
than together, the PEAP Official stated that the airport had run out of T-shirts and
therefore purchased them from the same company in order to have the same
design of T-shirt.
41. This explanation is not a credible one, since it suggests that the Airport did not
have any idea as to the numbers of temporary staff being taken on over a period
of only three months. If this was the case, it indicates poor management.
42. An alternative could be that two orders were placed to avoid having to organise a
competitive bidding procedure, since the limit for single source procurements at
that time was €1250.
43. The Security Official was also interviewed by the ITF in connection with the two
orders for t-shirts dated 1 July 2003 and 1 August 2003. He/she initially stated
that the t-shirts were purchased for 70 students hired in the summer of 2003.
However, he/she later added having re-read the documents that they were also
purchased for approximately 30 workers as well.
44. Whilst the requests do indicate the t-shirts to have been purchased for technical
services workers and students, both appear to relate to “physical workers”. In
view of the fact that the Security Official stated earlier in his/her interview that
each student would be allocated 3 shirts and one pair of trousers. The number of
t-shirts ordered -99 and 66- does not correspond with the number of employees.
45. In addition, the two requests specify that the shirts should be the same as the
previous shirts of the existing workers. This requirement suggests that Vendor 3,
who had just won a tender for the provision of summer uniforms to Pristina
Airport in April 2003, had already been chosen as the supplier.
46. The Security Official stated that he/she had been asked to write a request for
uniforms by the Divisional Manager following a conversation between them on
the need for uniforms for the student workers. When asked why he/she had
addressed the two requests to the PEAP Official rather than the Divisional
Manager, he/she replied that this was because the PEAP Official was his/her
superior. However, neither of the requests mentions that the Security Official has
spoken to the Divisional Manager.
747. The Security Official also indicated in his/her interview that he/she asked the
Divisional Manager whether a company could be found to supply the t-shirts as it
would be longer and more expensive if a tender procedure took place. When
questioned further about this response, he/she later added
“It was not foreseen to have a tender procedure in connection with the shirts
for students and the part time workers.”
48. However, he/she could not recall who authorised the purchase of the t-shirts
without a tender procedure. In summary, evidence from the two memoranda
requesting t-shirts and from the Security Official suggest that two orders were
placed within the space of one month with the company Vendor 3 in order to
avoid having to organise a competitive bidding procedure, since the limit for
single source procurements at that time was €1250. The documents also suggest
that the party who authorised the purchase was the PEAP Official.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
49. Whilst noting the comments in the capital expenditure approval that Vendor 3
was the only company that can provide the quality of uniforms needed within the
time limit, it is of concern that Vendor 3’s offer for winter uniforms in the sum of
€157,060 was almost twice as much as the other two bids from Vendor 1
(€80,198) and Vendor 2 (€86,850). However, this may in part be due to the fact
that the Vendor 2 submitted an offer that did not contain all the required articles,
whilst Vendor 1 produced uniforms of lower quality.
50. The only original bid documents seen by the ITF relating to the tender for the
supply of uniforms to administrative and maintenance personnel for the winter
season is the bid submitted by Vendor 3. Therefore, the ITF is unable to verify
the findings of the evaluation committee resulting in the rejection of the bids
submitted by the two other companies.
51. Evidence as to whether or not capital expenditure was or was not obtained prior
to signature of the contract is inconclusive, since the date on the contract, (6
December 2002) is contradicted by the routing slip dated 13 January 2003, which
suggests that the letter of notification and contract may not have been signed
until after 10 January 2003. The benefit of the doubt must therefore be given to
the Divisional Manager in this respect.
52. The offer received from Vendor 3 for the supply of for summer uniforms (€24,997)
was €3 below the maximum limit for competitive shopping of €25,000. This raises
concerns as to whether a competitive tender should have been held rather than
competitive shopping procedure.
53. Whilst there are some doubts as to the quality of uniforms produced by Vendor 1,
the selection of Vendor 2 appears to have been justified in view of its size and
reputation in the region. The ITF does not therefore find that the competitive
shopping procedure was organised in such a manner as to provide an unfair
advantage to the existing supplier Vendor 3.
54. The evidence that companies submitting bids were irregularly requested to
provide different quantities of items is not proven in the light of the response
given in interview by the Procurement Officer.
855. In spite of the explanation given by the PEAP Official, evidence from the Security
Official indicates that the two small orders for T-shirts were placed at a value of
€1188 and €792, in order to avoid having to organise a competitive shopping
procedure, since the limit for single source procurements at that time was €1250.
It is likely that this was a conscious decision and constitutes a breach of Article
24 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement
using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
56. It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV take appropriate action against PEAP
Official based on the findings of this report. (IV04/275/01)
57. It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV undertake a review of the procedures for
signing and dating contracts to ensure clarity as to the date on which a contract is
executed. (IV04/275/02)

Investigation Task Force
Irregularities in the procurement for the extension of the
Cargo Apron at Pristina Airport (Case 0282/04)
I. INTRODUCTION
1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28 February 2003 into the financial
statements of Pristina International Airport conducted by the Chartered
Accountants, which led to an investigation concerning alleged corruption and
irregularities arising in the course of procurements and contracts at Pristina
International Airport.
2. There are four specific allegations in this report of investigation:
• tender specifications produced by the Pristina Airport for the cargo apron
extension were insufficiently specific and without clear instructions for bidder
contrary to UNMIK Finance Regulation 1999/2;
• three persons on the bid opening committee were also part of the technical
evaluation committee contrary to procurement regulations;
• the contract for the cargo apron extension was not provided to the UNMIK
Office of the Legal Adviser for clearance; and
• it is alleged that the Vendor was allowed to certify its work as per the
requirements of the contract.
II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS
PROCEDURAL RULES
Section 1 of UNMIK Regulation 1999/24 dated 12 December 1999 as amended,
states that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:
a) “The regulations promulgated by the Special Representative of the
Secretary General (SRSG) and subsidiary instruments issued pursuant to
those regulations; and
b) The Law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.”
UN Staff Regulations 1.2 (b) stipulates, “Staff members shall uphold the highest
standards of efficiency, competence and integrity”
UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using
Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds provides that:
Article 4 1 – “Competition among and participation in the procurement process
shall be maximised.”2
Article 4.1.1 – “All Suppliers and Contractors and their tenders shall be treated
fairly, equally, and non-discriminatorily, without favouritism or prejudice and each
Tender shall be judged on its merits.”
Article 4.3.3. – “If a consultant or any principal, officer or employee of such
consultant has participated or will participate in any manner in the preparation of
the UNMIK Kosovo Interim Administration’s Tendering for a contract, including
but not limited to preparations of specifications or any other Tender Documents,
no such consultant nor any principal officer or employee of such consultant, no
“related person” nor any “illegal payer” may tender for or sponsor or participate in
the Tendering for such contract.”
Article 23.3 – “All tender documents shall contain complete information in neutral
and objective terms so that there can be full and fair competition among all
suppliers. In particular Tender Documents must include the advertisement and ..”
Article 23.3.4 – “…full technical specifications, including the time limits for
delivery and completion.”
Staff Rule 110.1: Misconduct. “Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her
obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and the
Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances, or to observe the standards of
conduct expected of an international civil servant, may amount to unsatisfactory
conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2, leading to the institution of
disciplinary measures for misconduct.”
III. METHODOLOGY
3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on
the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators
conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons
indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by
obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV,
which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.
IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
4. Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under
Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal
buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period
covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the
Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the
Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution
1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999.
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned
and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.
5. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina
Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,
including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised DOTI Official 1 (Department
of Transport and Infrastructure). The DOTI was later known as the Transport
Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left
UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an
international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations,3
reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001.
Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from the
armed forces of a United Nations member state, specifically Airport Engineer 1,
Airport Engineer 2, and Airport Engineer 3, and later by a consultant from the
Consulting Company.
6. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed
from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional
Manager was appointed. Under him were the PEAP Official and ATCS Official
(Air Traffic Control Services).
7. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been
under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under
ICAO regulations.
8. It is against this background of change that procurement procedures relating to
the following contract have been examined.
V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS
9. This part of the investigation relates to a tender for a contract for the extension of
the Cargo Terminal Apron at Pristina Airport. The value of the contract was
€774,318.63.
Allegation 1
(Specifically, the tender documents for the cargo apron did not comply with the
requirements of Article 23.4 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2
on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds, as they were
based on summary documents and did not include clear instructions on drawings
and plans.)
10. A note from the Project Engineer at the Evaluation Company to the PEAP
Official, dated 31 January 2001, indicates that the Evaluation Company was
commissioned to produce a preliminary design for the Cargo Terminal at Pristina
Airport. The design also provided for the construction of the Cargo Apron
Extension.
11. A prequalification evaluation was held 5 April 2001 as a result of which five
companies were pre-qualified to submit bids for the Cargo Apron Extension. Four
companies submitted bids, and following an evaluation, the contract was
awarded to the Vendor. A contract was signed for the Cargo Apron Extension on
11 September 2001.
12. A letter from the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP dated 9 May 2001 indicates that it
submitted a bid for the Cargo Apron Extension. The tender documents include
what appears to be a section from the preliminary design documents produced by
the Evaluation Company. Specifically, it includes a section entitled ”Bills of
Quantities” from pages 17 and 18 of the Evaluation Company preliminary design
documents.4
13. An interoffice memorandum providing an “outstanding issues update to Official
2”, from DOTI Official 3 to Staff member 1 at the office of Official 2 dated 18 May
2001, could give rise to the suggestion that offers were provided by companies
on 28 May 2001, and the Vendor had been chosen for the works in advance.
However, a more likely explanation is the date of the interoffice memorandum
has been incorrectly dated, since the document contains reference dates relating
to project “events” which post date 18 May 2001. At paragraph 2b, the interoffice
memorandum states that the Cargo Apron invitation to tender was based on
summary documents.
14. At paragraph 4 of the Cargo Apron Extension evaluation report dated 2 August
2001, the committee notes that the bidding documents did not include clear
instructions on drawing and plans. It therefore was recommended that
negotiations be held with the lowest bidder, the Vendor, on further details of the
scope of works.
15. In combination, the two documents suggest that the tender documents did not
comply with Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2
on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds.
16. When asked whether he/she was of the view that the tender documents complied
with the provisions of Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative
Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget
Funds, DOTI Official 2 conceded that if an engineer was asked this question,
he/she would indicate that the tender specifications were technically deficient and
did not comply with Article 23.3.
17. DOTI Official 2 explained that the technical details of the Cargo Apron extension
project were taken from the cargo terminal study produced by the Evaluation
Company and pasted into the tender document specifications. Thereafter, it was
up to the company winning the tender to demonstrate that they could fulfil the
specification.
18. According to DOTI Official 2, Airport Engineer 1, who arrived shortly after the
tender had been launched, had been angry with the Evaluation Company for
allowing DOTI Official 2 to send out excerpts of their study as the tender
specifications. Airport Engineer 1 had also expressed concern at the method
used for preparing the tender documents, as from an engineering point of view
the tenders did not contain sufficient detail. However, DOTI Official 2 stated that if
the Evaluation Company had been asked to prepare the tender documents, it
would have cost more money. He/she had therefore prepared the tender
documents himself/herself and sent them to a Procurement Official at the CPE to
review and help him with the procurement exercise.
19. Assistance from the CPE was provided primarily by a CPE Procurement Officer,
and to a lesser extent by the Procurement Official, as to the procurement
documents and rules. However, DOTI Official 2 expressed the view that neither
the Procurement Official nor the CPE Procurement Officer would have had the
technical expertise or time to review the technical specifications.5
20. DOTI Official 2 emphasised that there was no engineering expert to support
his/her work at the time the tender was launched, a fact that made his/her work
very difficult.
Allegations 2 & 3
(Specifically, three of the persons on the bid opening committee and evaluation
committees were the same parties who should not have carried out both tasks.)
and
(The contract for the Cargo Apron Extension was not channelled through the Office
of the Legal Adviser.)
21. The evaluation report dated 2 August 2001 is signed by three parties, who are
also listed as having attended the bid opening session. This indicates that the
composition of the bid opening committee and the evaluation committee
overlapped.
22. When asked about this issue in interview DOTI Official 2 confirmed that he/she
was both on the bid opening committee and was a member of the evaluation
committee. He/she added that the people who evaluated the offers signed the
evaluation report. This is in conflict with UN regulations, which segregate the two
roles. An interoffice memorandum dated 24 September 2001 indicates that the
contract for the Cargo Apron Extension had not been channelled through the
Office of the Legal Adviser.
Allegation 4
(Specifically, that the Vendor produced its own test results to confirm the quality of its
own work on the Cargo Apron, resulting in a conflict of interest.)
23. An interoffice memorandum from Staff member 2 to the Procurement Official,
signed by DOTI Official 1 dated 18 October 2001, indicates that DOTI Official 1
authorised the soil stabilisation work. The memorandum also adds that the work
was inadvertently not included in the original contract.
24. DOTI Official 2 told the ITF that in order to progress the cargo apron tender,
he/she had to organise a geographical survey. He/she added that only after the
tests were done could the tender go ahead. However, the evaluation report at
paragraph 4 suggests that information on the nature of the ground does not
appear to have been included in the tender documents. In addition, a letter from
the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP dated 27 June 2001, but apparently not
received at UNMIK and PEAP until 17 October 2001, according to a manuscript
note signed by Airport Engineer 1 at the bottom of the letter, suggests that it
carried out its own soil tests.
25. A letter from the Vendor to PEAP dated 18 September 2003 suggests that the
Vendor also produced its own bearing capacity report for the Cargo Apron,
thereby “self certifying” its own work. Whilst the tender documents at page 5,6
reference 11.4, provide for the Contractor to pay liquidated damages in the event
that the “load-bearing “ capacity of the apron is less than foreseen in the contract,
upon completion of the work, the contract is silent as to whom should carry out
the tests. However, it is questionable as to whether the Vendor should have
carried it out, since it presents a conflict of interest.
26. When asked about this in interview, the Divisional Manager stated:
“Without seeing any other documents, on the face of it, it does appear that there
could be a conflict of interest here. But the report was produced by a professional
pavement engineer, at a laboratory. Therefore, one can assume a certain degree
of integrity.”
27. The ITF notes that the PEAP Official indicated that he/she was unhappy about
the Vendor self-certifying its work and he/she commented that the airport
engineer should have questioned it.
28. The ITF does not have sufficient technical knowledge to assess the adequacy of
the Vendor’s work. However, a letter from the Divisional Manager to Staff
Member 3 dated 25 August 2002 gives rise to the possibility that it was not up to
specification in certain areas.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
29. Evidence indicates that the tender documents for the cargo apron did not comply
with the requirements of Article 23.4 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative
Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget
Funds, as they were based on summary documents and did not include clear
instructions on drawings and plans. This appears to have been due to an attempt
to cut costs in preparing the tender documents, as well as a lack of appropriately
qualified staff.
30. In mitigation, the inadequacy of the tender documents also appears to have been
due to ignorance as to the appropriate quantity of detail to be included in the
tender documents rather than a deliberate act calculated to manipulate the tender
process.
31. DOTI Official 2 is primarily responsible for the shortcomings in the tender
documents although, DOTI Official 1 and the CPE must also bear a certain
amount of responsibility.
32. The shortcomings in the tender documents are likely to have prejudiced some
companies in their decision as to submitting bids for the tenders, since they may
not have been clear as to the detailed requirements of the tender and therefore
submitted insufficient detail in their bids as a result.
33. Three persons are indicated to have both attended the bid opening session as
well as been on the tender evaluation committee, in conflict with UN regulations.
34. Evidence indicates the contract for the Cargo Apron Extension was not
channelled through the Office of the Legal Adviser.7
35. Evidence indicates that the Vendor produced its own bearing capacity report for
the Cargo Apron, thereby “self certifying” its own work and presenting a potential
conflict of interest.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
36. It is recommended that UNMIK ensure that all contracts are referred for legal
advice before signature in order to reduce potential liability issues and avoid a
recurrence of the problems of this instant case. (IV04/282/01)
37. It is recommended that UNMIK ensure that staff understand and comply with the
requirements of the UNMIK Public Procurement Regulation No 2004/3.
(IV04/282/02)
38. It is recommended that UNMIK ensures that all work conducted under contract, in
which the final product has to be evaluated, that said the evaluation be carried
out by a suitably qualified, independent entity. (IV04/282/03)
39. It is recommended that DPKO take appropriate action with respect to DOTI
Official 2 (currently serving with MONUC).

Case 0278/04
Pristina Airport - Alleged administrative irregularity regarding an FIDS Tender
Allegation
An official of a non-Airport related company, supported the procurement process for the supply
of the Flat Information Display System (FIDS) by writing the recommendation and justification
for a Single source procurement and also defined the technical specifications. As Vendor 1 was
only able to supply but not to cable the FIDS, another tender had to be launched for the FIDS
cabling. Winner of this tender was Vendor 2.
Background Information
The Single Source Procurement (Purchase and supply of FIDS) started on 17 October 2002 with a
written recommendation and justification by Vendor 2 Representative. The purchase of
additional FIDS became necessary because of the expansion of the Passenger Terminal Building.
The already existing system had been provided by Vendor 1, therefore the Airport Management
decided to choose Vendor 1 again.
The Capital Expenditure Approval and contract were signed on 13 December 2002. The
procurement file does not show why Vendor 1 only delivered the FIDS but did not cable it. The
need for cabling the FIDS resulted in another tender that commenced in March 2004. According
to the procurement file it appeared that Vendor 2 won the Competitive Shopping tender with an
amount of 15.919 Euro.
Investigative details
Although Vendor 2 Representative was never employed by the Airport the procurement file for
the FIDS supply contains two notes with regard to recommendation and justification for the FIDS
purchase dated both on 17 October 2002 and signed by Vendor 2 Representative. One note
appears on white paper, the other one on Airport headed notepaper.2
The interviews of Vendor 2 Representative were conducted on 31 August 2004 and 14 September
2004. Vendor 2 Representative stated that he/she was probably asked by a PEAP Official to write
a recommendation and justification note for the FIDS purchase. Vendor 2 at that time worked at
the Airport for another project linked to the FIDS. Vendor 2 was sub-contractor of Vendor 3
working at the Expansion of the Terminal Building and observing the need for more FIDS.
Vendor 2 Representative also stated that he/she with his/her company provided the Airport
procurement office with technical specifications for the FIDS cabling on request by the PEAP
Official. Vendor 2 Representative admitted that his/her involvement in the preparation of the
FIDS supply and cabling procurements and the later participation in the FIDS cabling tender by
his/her company put other competitors at a disadvantage. To prepare technical specifications for a
tender and to take part in the same was according to Vendor 2 Representative common practice
before the war.
During his/her interview on 9 September 2004 the PEAP official gave contradictory statements
with regard to his/her involvement in this case such as he/she probably had a meeting with
Vendor 2 Representative and the PEAP Engineer to discuss the FIDS supply and as one result
Vendor 2 Representative wrote the appropriate recommendation and justification note, but
elsewhere he/she denied to have ordered Vendor 2 Representative to do so.
The Airport Engineer was interviewed on 11 October 2004, as he/she is the responsible person to
suggest new projects to the Airport Management. The Airport Engineer stated that he/she was at
no time involved in the FIDS purchase and did not request the support by Vendor 2
Representative with regard to recommend and justify the FIDS supply. The Airport Engineer only
recommended the cabling of the FIDS in a note to the Airport Management; all following
procedures are under the responsibility of the procurement unit and the management.
The Sales Manager of Vendor 1 was interviewed on the phone on 30 August 2004. Asked why
Vendor 1 did not provide with the cabling of the FIDS he/she stated that Vendor 1’s management
did not allow traveling to Kosovo at that time for security reasons. The Sales Manager of Vendor
1 also mentioned that the Airport's contact person with regard to the FIDS cabling was
for him/her Vendor 2 Representative.
Conclusions
Fact is that Vendor 2 Representative was involved in the procurement process for the FIDS
supply and the FIDS cabling despite he/she was not an employee at the Airport or KTA
procurement unit. The excuse by Vendor 2 Representative that such an involvement was common
practice before the war has nowadays definitely lost its validity.
It has to be assumed that Vendor 2 won the FIDS cabling tender only due to the fact
that the company was definitely in advantage with regard to advanced knowledge of the
technical requirements and had therefore sufficient time to prepare a good bid in terms of the
price.
Although PEAP Official as the responsible official at that time denied that he/she had requested
Vendor 2 Representative support for the FIDS supply and cabling procurements, Vendor 2
Representative granted the ITF that he/she acted on PEAP Official’s request.3
Nevertheless, PEAP official bears the overall responsibility for his/her department (PEAP), and
this investigation proved again that he/she did not fully meet the requirements as manager in a
sensitive area like the Airport.
The entire matter has to be seen as an administrative irregularity. It is obvious that international
procurement rules had been breached but the Procurement Regulation that was in force at that
-
time - Financial Agreement 1999/2 does not indicate cases like described before.
Furthermore, to prove a possible case of corruption, there are not enough indications.
Recommendations
It is recommended that UNMIK, and in particular, the KTA undertake the following actions:
Recommendation 1: PEAP Official should be replaced by a highly qualified manager whose
skills meet international management standards.
Recommendation 2: The Airport staff responsible for procurement activity has to receive
adequate training in the handling of procurement matters and to adhere to all applicable
Procurement Regulations.

Investigation Task Force
Case 287/04
October 26, 2004
Pristina Airport – Alleged administrative irregularity regarding an X-RAY Tender
Allegation
On the 29th May 2003, the Divisional Manager, Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) [UNMIK EU-
Pillar IV], approved and signed a contract between Pristina Airport and the Vendor before
the Capital Expenditure was formally approved by KTA.
Background Information
On 7 March 2003, Pristina Airport launched an international tender to supply X-ray
equipment. On 4 April 2003, the Evaluation Committee awarded the contract to the Vendor,
who had not submitted the lowest tender, but, was the only company that met the rigorous
technical specifications. The Vendor is acknowledged as a world-class company specializing
in such equipment.
The contract between Pristina Airport and the Vendor was concluded on 10 April 2003. It is
not clear when the Vendor signed this document. The KTA Internal Auditor 1 expressed
concerns over the conclusion of the contract, which resulted in the Divisional Manager
signing on behalf of the Procuring Entity on 29 May 2003. KTA Official 1 also signed the
contract, but did not record the date against his/her name.
The Capital Expenditure Approval, dated 19 June 2003, was signed by KTA Official 2, on 20
June 2003.
Investigative details
On 23 June 2004, ITF investigators interviewed the Divisional Manager, who explained that
he/she believed he/she was authorized to sign the contract after having received the approval
for the Capital Expenditure from the KTA.
1Confronted with the documents that showed he/she had signed the X-Ray Contract with the
Vendor before the Capital Expenditure request was approved by KTA, he/she stated that
KTA probably gave him a verbal approval
KTA Finance Official could neither confirm nor disprove this claim as there is no evidence
of the verbal approval being granted.
The Divisional Manager also signed the Letter of Notification to the Vendor (dated 10 April
2003) on 29 May 2003 before KTA approved the Capital Expenditure on 20 June 2003. It is
not clear when the Letter of Notification was sent to the Vendor; according to the Divisional
Manager the Airport did not inform the company before the Capital Expenditure Approval
was signed.
ITF investigators have carefully studied the applicable law, such as the Finance
Administration Instruction 1999/2 (UNMIK), Assembly of Kosovo – Law on Public
Financial Management and Accountability 2003/2 and Assembly of Kosovo – Law on Public
Procurement in Kosovo 2003/17 (initially foreseen to be into force 9 June 2004, new date 1
October 2004), and have spoken to KTA Finance Official and KTA Internal Auditor 2 to
clarify if the facts specified either breached the above regulations or internal KTA rules. No
breaches of UNMIK Regulations or internal KTA rules were identified by KTA Finance
Official or KTA Internal Auditor 2.
Conclusions
The fact that the Divisional Manager signed a Contract and Letter of Notification before
receiving the signed Capital Expenditure Approval from the KTA should be seen as a minor
administrative irregularity, particularly since he/she instructed KTA Official 1 by
memorandum of 23 June 2003 (three days after KTA’s approval) to inform the supplier of
the agreement of the contract.
The ITF found no evidence of financial loss to the Pristina Airport or the KTA.
Recommendations.
This results of this investigation do not reach a level where recommendations for
administrative action are necessary, however, it is recommended that UNMIK, and in
particular, the KTA undertake the following actions:
Recommendation 1: That airport staff responsible for procurement activity have received
adequate training in the handling of procurement matters:
Recommendation 2: That airport staff responsible for procurement activity strictly adhere to
all applicable Procurement Regulations;
Recommendation 3: That airport and KTA staff authorized to sign contract documentation
only do so after receiving written approvals on Capital Expenditures.

Investigation Task Force
16 August 2004
REPORT ON ALLEGATIONS OF EVASION OF PRISTINA AIRPORT CHARGES
(ITF CASE NO. 0262/04)
I. INTRODUCTION
1. In July 2004, the Investigation Task Force (ITF) received information alleging that
Pristina Airport failed to collect all revenues for landing, handling and passenger tax.
The ITF was advised that the Airline, a regular user of Pristina Airport, was not
paying the correct landing charges and airport passenger tax. The information
indicated that the airline always paid its charges in cash. It was also alleged that there
was also no record of any airport passenger tax being paid for passengers departing
with the airline.
II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2. The Airline flies to Pristina Airport from a European Airport every Thursday carrying
Kosovar passengers who have been found to enter the referred European state
illegally. The Airline is contracted with the foreign state’s Immigration Department.
A representative of the Immigration Department and 25 or more “Securicor” security
staff routinely escort the passengers on the flights to Pristina.
3. On the return leg to the mentioned state, the Airline flight carries passengers from
Pristina, consisting of the returning Securicor escorts, the representative of
Immigration, and in addition, a number of police officers of the concerned state
currently working for UNMIK CIVPOL. These CIVPOL officers travel to the UK
without payment, but with the knowledge and approval of both Airline and the U.K.
Immigration Department.
III. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS
4. ITF Investigators obtained a number of documents from Pristina Airport officials
including records of funds received from the Airline for the period January to June
2004. These funds are broken down into handling, landing, airport passenger, and
departure tax. The schedule also lists the individual Airport receipt number recorded
for each cash payment. There was no record of the Airline having paid airport tax.
ITF Report 262/04 15. ITF Investigators spoke to both Official 1 and Official 2 of the Airline and requested
copies of receipts issued by Pristina Airport in respect of fees paid by the Airline to
the airport, as well as the Aircraft ""Load Sheets"" for May and June 2004. These
documents record details such as the weight of the aircraft including the MTOW
(maximum take off weight).
6. Airline Official 1 explained that the Airline paid cash for handling and landing
charges to the Pristina Airport Passenger Handling Services Department on each
occasion his aircraft used the airport. Airline Official 1 explained that he/she had
endeavored to open a credit account with Pristina Airport, but without success.
7. The ITF sought the assistance of the Security Officer at Pristina Airport, in order to
monitor Airline passenger movements. On 22 July 2004, ITF Investigators monitored
the Airline’s inward and outward flights and related airport activities. It was noted
that whilst the arriving Kosovar passengers went through immigration procedures
before entering into the arrivals lounge, the 25 security escorts and the representative
of the related Immigration Department remained airside at all times awaiting
instructions to return to the aircraft. They did not enter the terminal building.
8. Other passengers departing with the Airline met in the Airport public lounge. Their
identities were checked against a list provided by an UNMIK CIVPOL officer in
consultation with the Immigration representative. They then went through
conventional immigration and X-Ray searches and were escorted into the departure
lounge before boarding the Airline aircraft. They did not, however, pass through
regular check-in procedures at any time.
9. ITF Investigators reviewed all paperwork relating to this flight. An Official of the
Passenger Handling Services, Pristina Airport, provided the receipt book used to
evidence cash payments for landing, handling and airport passenger taxes. It was
noted that other airlines, particularly those not visiting Pristina on a regular basis, pay
in cash for handling services.
10. Details shown on the records provided by Pristina Airport officials were reconciled
with this receipt book. The dates, amounts and breakdown of charges were confirmed.
The pilot is required to sign the receipt book, and the ITF verified the recorded
signature against the Airline ""Load Sheets"" as genuine.
11. The charges themselves, as calculated by the Airport Handling Services Department
for Airline flights, were scrutinized against the published ""Price List for Basic Airport
Services"" issued on 1 January 2002.
12. Details recorded on the ""Load Sheets"" confirmed the handling charge of 1074 Euros
was also found to be correct. The landing charge of €676.44 was, however, reduced
by 50% as this flight was identified as a “humanitarian flight” and as such qualified
for the discount. The Official of the Passenger Handling Services, Pristina Airport
told the ITF Investigators that she regarded the returning Kosovars as refugees and the
discount as appropriate. The ITF Investigators checked this matter with the Official of
the Airport General Services, who confirmed he/she was aware of this discount and
did not dispute this interpretation of the flight.
ITF Report 262/04 213. ITF Investigators asked the Official of the Passenger Handling Services, Pristina
Airport to describe the airport tax obligations for such flights. The Official stated that
the tax of €15 per passenger is payable in respect of departing passengers only. The
Official explained that this tax is normally collected by the airlines using the check-in
facilities as part of normal boarding procedures. He/She explained that the security
guards and U.K. Immigration staff who remained airside awaiting return to the UK
had not technically entered the Airport and as such were not liable for airport taxes. In
respect of the other departing passengers, the Official said there was no obligation for
the payment of this tax because neither the carrier nor the passengers used the regular
check-in facilities of the Airport.
14. The ITF reviewed the conventional check-in procedures at the Pristina Airport and
confirmed they complied with observations provided by the Senior Official of the
Pristina Airport in response to a Management Letter dated May 2004 on the 2003
Financial Audit from auditing company. An extract of the advice states the following:
’53. Passenger Fees
OBSERVATION
In the process of modernization of the Airport, Entity has acquired and implemented a
so-called automatic checking system. This system provides accurate evidence of
passengers’ arriving and departure. However, PA has still not integrated and/or
connected the automatic checking system with financial reporting
54. Establishment of an integrated system could provide efficient monitoring
controls and accurate evidence, completeness and reconciliation of the number of
passenger recorded by the automatic checking system and the revenue from
passenger fees in the financial statement.
Management Comment: Full integration will be achieved by the new system. At
present, passenger and baggage check-in and boarding is automatically connected to
the load sheet. The load sheet contains all relevant facts concerning the flight,
including type and quantity of passengers. This report is signed by Airport load
control staff, compared to a head-count on board the aircraft conducted by aircraft
staff and is thereafter signed by the pilot before take-off. A copy of this confirmed
report is used as a basis for invoicing. We use the information that later will be
retrieved automatically by the new system.’
15. The possible loss of revenue of departing passenger taxes is another matter requiring
attention from airport management.
IV. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
16. There is no evidence that the Airline have sought to avoid any charges levied by
Pristina Airport. All charges levied upon the Airline by Pristina Airport for incoming
and outgoing flights have been paid and receipts issued. The charges applied to the
Airline flights are in accordance with listed charges for services.
17. The identification of the flight as ""humanitarian"" is a matter for closer review by
Airport Pristina management to ensure compliance with airport charges.
ITF Report 262/04 318. The recently appointed Senior Official of the Pristina Airport, when advised by the
ITF of the number of cash transactions, was unaware that this practice continued
within the Passenger Handling Services Department.
19. The information as to a credit arrangement for the Airline was also provided to the
Pristina Airport Senior Official by the ITF for his/her action.
20. The charges shown in the ""Price List for Basic Airport Services"" correspond with
those charged to the Airline. In addition, the audit trail in respect of the cash handling
receipts, recording, and reconciliation with the cashbooks and airport’s records
showed no discrepancies.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
21. Recommendation No. 1: Airport Pristina management address the request of the
Airline to be granted conventional credit facilities without further delay
(IV04/262/01);
22. Recommendation No. 2: The Official of the Airport General Services immediately
review the reasons why cash transactions still occur for standard services such as
handling and landing, and endeavour to cease this practice where possible
(IV04/262/02);
23. Recommendation No. 3: Airport Pristina Management Group review the matters
raised in this report and provide a written response to the issues described herein to
the Office for Coordination of Oversight of Publicly-Owned Enterprises
(IV04/262/03).

Investigation Task Force
Allegation of Possible Bribery at Pristina Airport (Case No. 0218/04)
I. INTRODUCTION
1. On 29 April 2004 a Divisional Manager, UNMIK Pillar IV, alleged that in October
2002, an envelope containing €5200 was left in the office of an official of Public
Enterprise Airport Pristina (PEAP), by an unidentified individual. On 4 October
2002, a group of approximately 8 persons, including a KTA Procurement
Specialist and Company 1 representative, had attended a meeting in his office
concerning a procurement contract for the building of a new car park at Pristina
International Airport.
II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS
PROCEDURAL RULES
2. This case concerns an allegation of attempted bribery and corruption as cited in
Article 344 of the Provisional Criminal Code of Kosovo.
III. METHODOLOGY
3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on
the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. (ITF) All relevant persons were
interviewed and all relevant documentation was obtained and reviewed.
4. The KTA Procurement Specialist, who attended the earlier meeting in the office
of the PEAP Official, was interviewed concerning the incident. The Company 1
representative was not interviewed in this matter by the ITF due to an ongoing
criminal investigation in which he/she is a witness. The ITF did not wish to
interfere in a judicial investigation.
5. The ITF made contact with the Acting Commissioner of Police in Kosovo in order
to ascertain the status of police enquiries into the matter.
IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
6. On 29 April 2004, the Divisional Manager advised the ITF of an incident which
had occurred “sometime in October 2002”, which he/she “thought” he/she had
raised with the ITF previously. However, no evidence of this report could be
located nor recalled by any members of the ITF.
7. The Divisional Manager provided the ITF with a copy of documents passed to an
UNMIK police officer, on 11 October 2002 at UNMIK Police in Fush, Kosovo,
concerning the incident.8. The documents consist of a letter from the Divisional Manager to the UNMIK
Police Officer dated 11 October 2002, and a file note from the PEAP Official,
dated 8 October 2002, to the Divisional Manager, detailing the incident and
annexing a list of serial numbers of Euro notes totalling €5,200 alleged to have
been left in the PEAP official’s diary in his office. .
9. The Divisional Manager explained that he/she was away from the Airport from the
middle of September 2002 until the beginning of October 2002. Upon his/her
return, he/she was visited in his office by the PEAP Official. The latter informed
him/her that the previous Friday (believed to be 4 October 2002), a meeting had
been held in his (the PEAP Official’s) office, with persons bidding for the
procurement contract for the new car parking area.
10. The note dated 8 October 2002 from the PEAP Official, indicates that the persons
who had attended a meeting were the Company 1 Representative, an engineer
from the contractor “escavator” and the KTA Procurement Specialist.
11. The following morning, the PEAP Official entered his office and found an
unmarked, partly sealed envelope in his/her diary that contained €5,200 in cash.
The PEAP Official informed the Divisional Manager about the matter and
confirmed that there was no accompanying note, or explanation for the cash
being in his/her diary.
12. The Divisional Manager then reported the incident to his/her then chain of
command, and the matter was passed to the UNMIK police.
V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS
13. Analysis of the note written by the PEAP Official suggests that the company
referred to in his note as “escavator” is in fact Company 1, who won the contract
for the construction of the new car park at Pristina Airport and whose
representative, attended a meeting in the PEAP Official’s office one day prior to
the discovery of the money.
14. The sum of €5,200 alleged to have been left in the envelope is unusual, since
one would expect the sum to have been a “round sum” such as €5000.
15. It should be noted that an interoffice memorandum from a former Airport
Engineer to the KTA Procurement Specialist, dated 26 September 2002, alleged
that the PEAP Official had accepted an open envelope of documents relating to
the car park tender from Company 2, after the time for submission of bids had
concluded and contrary to accepted procurement procedures on the handling of
bids. (This allegation is addressed in ITF Case No. 0274/04)
16. The KTA Procurement Specialist told the ITF that a meeting had been held in the
PEAP Official’s office with Company 1, attended by the Company 1
Representative and a Company 1 engineer. The purpose of the meeting had
been to hand the contract for the new car park to Company 1 and the Company 1
Representative to sign it. The KTA Procurement Specialist indicated that there
were three or four other persons present, two of whom, he/she thought may be
two staff members of Pristina Airport. The KTA Procurement Specialist added
that it was normal practice for the party winning the bid to be invited to sign the
contract in this way.
217. The KTA Procurement Specialist also indicated that he/she did not see anything
placed in the PEAP Official’s office or diary, although he/she later heard about
the incident. He/she expressed his/her opinion that the incident had been
arranged to “break up” the contract with Company 1, but did not indicate by
whom.
18. The ITF reviewed the letter from the Divisional Manager to the UNMIK Police
Officer, which indicates that the matter was referred to the UNMIK police on 11
October 2002. The letter also records that the sum of €5,200 was handed to the
UNMIK Police Officer.
19. The UNMIK Police Officer, who is now based in Iraq, told the ITF that he/she
served in Kosovo between June 2001 and November 2002 and recalls the
incident being reported. He/she stated that at that time he/she was serving with
the Border Police Investigations Unit and had assigned this enquiry to his then
supervisor. The latter was unable to be interviewed as he/she had left the
Mission.
20. ITF investigators visited the Border Boundary Police and interviewed two current
investigators. Neither officer recalled the incident, but they made extensive
enquiries in an attempt to trace the police report and locate the €5,200. They
were unsuccessful on both counts.
21. On 27 September 2004, the ITF sent a letter to UNMIK Police Officer 2, in an
effort to determine what investigations had been undertaken into the matter, the
result of those investigations and the whereabouts of the money.
22. The UNMIK Police Officer 2 indicated that Regional Crime Squad Pristina Region
was undertaking an investigation into the matter, which therefore, remains an
open investigation.
23. The ITF then contacted the Regional Crime Squad and meetings were held with
two officials.
24. The ITF obtained a draft of the assigned officer’s report into the case, which
indicates that the case had been opened in 2004. The two-page report indicates
that the assigned officer had interviewed the PEAP Official, who had indicated
that he/she did not understand why the envelope would have been left in his
office, as he/she had no responsibility for the car park contract. The PEAP Official
also stated that he/she had contacted the Company 1 Representative, who
denied any knowledge of the envelope. The report also indicates that statements
are to be taken from the Company 1 Representative and from the KTA
Procurement Specialist.
25. The Company 1 Representative was not interviewed by the ITF due to his role as
a witness in an ongoing police investigation and any investigative activity by the
ITF may have impacted upon that judicial inquiry.
26. The ITF has also been informed that the €5,200, which is the subject of the
attempted bribery case, is still missing and a police inquiry has commenced into
its disappearance.
3VI. FINDINGS OF FACT
27. Evidence adduced by the ITF gives rise to the possibility that an attempt was
made to make a corrupt payment to the PEAP Official in October 2002.
Specifically, a sum of money was left in the diary of the PEAP Official in his office
at Pristina Airport. The matter was correctly passed to UNMIK police in October
2002 and is currently under investigation.
28. The €5,200, which is the subject of the attempted bribery case, is missing and an
inquiry has been started into its disappearance.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
29. Evidence indicates that an attempt was made to make a corrupt payment to the
PEAP Official. No evidence exists as to why or by whom.
30. The criminal case was passed to UNMIK police over two years ago and is
currently under investigation.
31. The ITF case is now closed in order to avoid any duplication or interference of the

Investigation Task Force
Alleged irregularities in a contract for the construction of garages and a
parking area for Air Traffic Control Services at Pristina Airport and in an annex
agreement for the supply of new offices, training room and maintenance
garage for the Rescue Fire Fighting Service (Case 0276/04)
I. INTRODUCTION
1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28 February 2003 into the financial
statements of Pristina International Airport conducted by the Chartered
Accountants, which led to an investigation concerning alleged corruption and
irregularities arising in the course of procurements and contracts at Pristina
International Airport.
2. There are four specific allegations in this report of investigation:
• Extra work to the value of €25,935.74 was added to the main contract without
any supporting documentation;
• The Divisional Manager of the Airports Sector KTA authorised the Annex
Agreement to proceed in spite of the fact that the contract exceeded his/her
authorisation limit of €25,000 to sign and approve a contract which deviated
from the normal procurement procedure;
• Extra work to the value of €1,390 was added to the Annex agreement without
any supporting documentation indicating either the nature of the extra works
or appropriate authorisation.
• The Divisional Manager of the Airports Sector KTA failed to secure funding
approval prior to authorising expenditure for the annex agreement.
II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS

III. METHODOLOGY
3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on
the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators
conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons
indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by
obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV,
which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.
IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
4. Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under
Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal
buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period
covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the
Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the
Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution
1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999.
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned
and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.
5. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina
Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,
including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport
and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport
Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left
UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an
international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations,
reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001.
Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from a
member state’s armed forces specifically Airport Engineer I, Airport Engineer 2
and Airport Engineer 3, and later by the Consultant from the Consulting Firm
26. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed
from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional
Manager was appointed at the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under
him/her were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS)
Official 1.
7. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been
under the jurisdiction of KFOR, was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under
ICAO regulations.
8. It is against this background of change that procurement procedures relating to
the following contract have been examined.
V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS
9. This report relates to Contract Ref ATCS/PA/COC W 02-02 for the construction of
garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) at the Pristina
Airport. It also deals with a further single source contract Annex Agreement Ref
ACTS/PA/COC/W 02-02 for the supply of new offices, training room and
maintenance garage for the Rescue Fire Fighting Service. The value of the main
contract was €263,093 and the Annex Agreement €33,927 .
Allegation 1
(Extra work to the value of €25 935.74 was added to the main contract for the
construction of garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services, without
any supporting documentation detailing the nature of the extra works or appropriate
authorisation)
10. A bid evaluation report dated 30 September 2002 indicates that following an
evaluation of 9 bids the contract for the construction of garages and a parking
area for Air Traffic Control Services was awarded to a the company in Pristina. A
bid evaluation report letter from the ATCS Procurement Officer at Pristina Airport
dated 1 October 2002 indicates that the Vendor was selected as having the
lowest price (€263,093) of the three companies selected for further evaluation.
11. A contract dated 30 September 2002 was signed with the Vendor by ATCS at
Pristina Airport on 11 October 2002.
12. A schedule of payments for the main contract indicates that a sum of €25, 935.74
was added to the cost of the contract. However, there are no documents in the
contract file indicating the nature of the extra works or under what procedure they
were authorised.
13. When asked about this issue by the ITF, the Divisional Manager stated that
he/she would have expected to see a schedule of extra works in the contract file.
However, it was not in the file. He/she therefore could not state to what the extra
works related or under what procedure they were authorised.
14. ATCS Official 1, when asked about the nature of the works and the whereabouts
of supporting documentation, stated that the request for the extra expenditure
came from KFOR. He/she added that he/she was sure there was a justification
3from KFOR to carry out the extra works and that it had been agreed in all the
meetings between KFOR, UNMIK and the Airport.
15. On 6 October 2004, an ATCS Employee, provided ITF Investigators an
explanation for the extra work and produced a spreadsheet detailing how the
figures had been determined.
16. According to the ATCS Employee, there had been an arithmetical error in the bill
of quantities for the main contract, which had not been picked up by the
evaluation committee. This had resulted in a reduction in the price of the contract
from €263,093 to €260,726.81.
17. ATCS Official 2 had subtracted the sum attributable to this arithmetical error from
the contract, (€2366.19) and then carried out a review of the specifications. The
review had resulted in a figure of €265,034.62 (€1941.62 more than the stated
contract price of €263,093) due to items missed in the bill of quantities.
18. Additional ground stabilisation work totalling €23,994.08 was then added to the
specification review work, amounting to the difference between the original
contract price of €263,093 and the final invoice price of €289,028.74, giving a
total of €25,935.57 for extra work.
19. This explanation was later confirmed by ATCS Official 2 in a further meeting with
the ITF on 20 October 2004. ATCS Official 2 also confirmed that the extra work
had not been recorded in written form, as it followed a visit to the construction site
by the Divisional Manager and ATCS Official 1.
20. In summary, there are no documentary records to support the extra works. The
only financial documentation on file authorising the extra works appears to be a
signed schedule of payments, which includes the provision of €25,935.74 for
extra works.
Allegation 2
(The Divisional Manager authorised the Annex Agreement to proceed in spite of the
fact that the contract exceeded his authorisation limit of €25, 000 to sign and
approve a contract which deviated from the normal procurement procedure under
Article 6.3 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public
Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds);
and
Allegation 3
(Extra work to the value of €1,390 was added to the Annex Agreement without any
supporting documentation indicating either the nature of the extra works or
appropriate authorisation)
21. A note from KFOR to ATCS Official 1 and the Divisional Manager dated 21
January 2003 attaching minutes of a meeting dated 7 January 2003, indicates
that an urgent request was made for construction of a fire-fighters office and
maintenance offices, in anticipation of Iceland taking over from Italy as “Lead
Nation” in March 2003.
22. An annex agreement in the sum of €33,927 was signed with the Vendor for
construction of a fire-fighters office and maintenance offices on 7 February 2003,
4supported by a justification from the Divisional Manager also dated 7 February
2003.
23. A schedule of payments dated 19 March 2003 relating to the annex agreement
indicates that a sum of €1,390 was added to the cost of the contract. However,
there are no documents in the contract file indicating the nature of the extra
works or under what procedure they were authorised.
24. When asked about the extra payment in interview, the Divisional Manager
indicated that from the documents presented to him/her (specifically the contract
file) he/she could not say what the extra works were. He/she added that without
looking at the works covered by the contract he/she could not know whether or
not there was any provision for extra expenditure.
25. ATCS Official 1, when asked about the extra payment in interview stated that
he/she would have to check airport administration records and provide this
information. On 27 September 2004, ATCS Official 1 had a meeting with the ITF
at which he/she indicated that the extra work related to a request from KFOR for
a stair rail and the creation of a storage space under the stairs of the training
offices for fire fighter’s breathing equipment, together with office partitioning for
the fire-fighter’s offices. In support of this, he/she produced a copy of a
manuscript diary entry and a note dated 27 September 2004, drawn up by the
Vendor, listing these items as the extra works carried out. This indicates that
there was no supporting documentation for the extra work when it was carried
out. The only financial documentation on file authorising the extra works appears
to be a signed schedule of payments, which includes the provision of €1,390 for
extra works.
Allegation 4
(It is alleged that the Divisional Manager failed to secure funding approval prior to
authorising expenditure for the Annex Agreement to construct a fire-fighters office
and maintenance offices)
26. A capital expenditure approval dated 4 March 2003 shows that the Divisional
Manager authorised the Annex Agreement to proceed in spite of the fact that the
contract exceeded his/her authorisation limit of €25,000. In addition, the
document indicates that the work had already been completed by the time that
financial approval was sought for the expenditure.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
27. There is no supporting documentation or appropriate authorisation for the extra
works in the sum of €25,935.74 arising from the main contract for the
construction of garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services. This is
contrary to Article 8.2 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on
Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds.
28. The same is applicable to the extra works in the sum of €1,390 relating to the
Annex Agreement for construction of a fire-fighters office and maintenance
offices. This is again contrary to Article 8.2 of UNMIK Finance Administrative
Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget
Funds.
529. In addition, the Divisional Manager authorised the Annex Agreement to proceed
in spite of the fact that the contract exceeded his/her authorisation limit of
€25,000 to sign and approve a contract which deviated from the normal
procurement procedure under Article 6.3 of UNMIK Finance Administrative
Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget
Fund.
30. Evidence indicates that the Divisional Manager failed to secure funding approval
prior to authorising expenditure for the annex agreement to construct a fire-
fighters office and maintenance offices. This is contrary to Article 8.2 of UNMIK
Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo
Consolidated Budget Funds.
31. In mitigation, the construction of a fire-fighters office and maintenance offices do
appear to have been required as a matter of urgency.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
32. The ITF recommends the following;
Given that the Divisional Manager has left the Mission and cannot be sanctioned for
his/her actions, it is recommended that UNMIK (Pillar IV) should place a copy of this
report on his/her personnel file for future reference. (IV04/276/01)
It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV take appropriate action against ATCS
Official 2 as the official having responsibility for the ATCS for his/her failure to ensure
that the extra work was adequately documented and authorised. (IV04/277/02)

INVESTIGATION TASK FORCE
Allegation of fraud in handling and accounting of Cargo
at Pristina Airport (Case No. 0192/04)
I. Introduction
1. The Investigation Task Force (ITF) received a report that the Cargo Department at
Pristina Airport had improperly sought payment for importation and storage of goods
owned by the Company. It was further alleged that an amount of €8,000.00 was sought
and received by an official (Official 1) of the Pristina Airport, which was illegal and
therefore not recorded in the accounts of the Airport.
2. After the ITF conducted a preliminary investigation into this allegation, prima
facie evidence of a crime was identified and the case was referred to the Department of
Justice, Pillar I, UNMIK, on July 22nd, 2004 for further judicial action. This report is a
summary of the information adduced during the investigation.
II. Background
3. ITF Investigators met with the Company Representative, who explained that a
part of his business involves the importation and marketing of LED display equipment.
The Company consists of 4 partners:
• Partner 1
• Partner 2
• Partner 3
• Partner 4
4. The above company partners agreed to the following regarding the various
payments to be effected as follows:
• Partner 2 and Partner 3 were to pay the total price of all the goods;
• Partner 1 was to pay everything regarding VAT, Custom Duties, Local Taxes and
Storage.III. THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF
AIRPORT PRISTINA CARGO OFFICIALS
5. In general terms, airport officials are required to act in the best interests of Airport
Pristina, a Kosovo Publicly Owned Enterprise (POE), while performing their duties and
establishing and maintaining a responsible and transparent business framework in which
Airport Pristina can function. All Cargo Department officials are obliged to follow the
applicable law, and internal Rules, Regulations and Instructions, when dealing with
Airport Pristina assets, resources and facilities.
6. Official 2 was responsible for the daily control and management of the Cargo
section, including its assets and resources. He had the responsibility to ensure that all
contracts concluded on behalf of Airport Pristina regarding storage fees payable by
importers complied with the applicable law, regulations and instructions, and that they
were subject to full and fair competition, openness and transparency and free from
conflict of interest and corruption. His/her duty was to conduct the affairs of Airport
Pristina as a senior official with the utmost integrity and transparency and to be fully
accountable to the Board of Airport Pristina.
7. It was Official 2’s responsibility to ensure that storage fees were paid and a record
of the payments be kept. The procedure for recording payments is that the airway bill
with a customs stamp should have been provided to the Finance Officer whereby he/she
then calculates the storage fees owed. Before individuals or companies were allowed to
retrieve their goods, this fee had to be paid pursuant to an official invoice. In this instant
case, there is no record of such an invoice or any such payment. The absence of such a
record is highly unusual and establishes that monies owed to the airport were not received
in this case.
8. Official 1 worked in the Cargo Handling Office at the Airport. As with Official 2,
it was Official 1’s duty to ensure that all payments made by customers of the airport
complied with the applicable regulations and instructions.
III. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS
9. A consignment of “LED Display equipment and accessories” for the Company
arrived at the airport via Airline 1 on 26 December 2003, and consisted of four pallets
containing 27 packages with a total weight of 976 kg. These goods were imported from
Beirut and were accompanied by an Air Waybill.
10. The Company Representative was advised by Partner 2 of the consignment’s
arrival. Partner 2 was also the person that handed over the Air Waybill to the Company
Representative.11. At the time the consignment arrived in Kosovo, the Company did not have
permission to erect the LED screen on any city building for advertisement purposes as
they had intended. This authorization was granted sometime later, circa March/April
2004.
12. The merchandise in question was paid for and cleared on the 15th of March 2004,
by the nominated Shipping Agent. The same Agent, on behalf of the Company, paid a
total amount of €11,581.00, VAT and Customs Duties included.
13. Once all the payments had been effected, the Company Representative went to the
Cargo Building to pick up his goods, but according to his statements, he/she was
approached by Official 1, who advised the Company Representative that he/she was now
required to pay the amount of €32,800.00 that included a storage charge for the period 26
December 2003 to 15 March 2004.
14. Partner 2 was astonished at this excessive charge for storage. At this point, the
Company management agreed to leave the goods in storage and decide on what action to
take. They identified the possibility of returning the goods to their place of origin, due to
the fact that the storage would have cost them nearly as much as the price of the screen
(US$54,000.00).
15. Official 1 then advised the Company Representative that he would do everything
in his/her power to assist in settling this situation, including an offer to lower the storage
charge. Sometime thereafter, Official 1 advised the Company Representative that he/she
was able to decrease the storage charge to €8,000.00 based on his/her position and
connections at the Airport.
16. The Company management accepted the new offer and agreed to pay the lower
storage charge of €8.000.00. However, due to the fact that Partner 1 did not have
€8,000.00 in cash, he/she commenced a search amongst his/her friends for the money.
Subsequently, Partner 1 was able to raise the money to pay both the Custom Excise and
Airport Storage fees.
17. On the 16th of March 2004, Partner 1 paid the €8,000.00 to the Company
Representative, who then went to Pristina Airport to hand it to Official 1. The Company
Representative stated that the hand-over of the cash to Official 1 took place outside the
airport terminal gate. The Airport X-Ray Operator, who observed the meeting between
the two men, corroborated the fact that the meeting took place as stated.
18. ITF Investigators visited the Cargo Department Finance Office to check official
documentation in relation to the Company merchandise. No trace of the payment of the
€8,000 could be found in the Cargo Department account books for 2003 or 2004.19. According to the tariff list that the Finance Officer of the Cargo Section provided
to the ITF, the Company should have paid an amount of approximately €32,000.00 for
storage fees from the 23rd of December 2003 to 15th of March 2004.
20. In view of the above, ITF Investigators interviewed Official 2 who offered no
justifiable explanation as to why no payment had been effected with respect to the
Company goods. He/she simply repeated that the goods were confiscated from the
Customs Service and that just a minor payment of storage fees should have occurred.
Unfortunately, no trace of payment (current official storage price list payment or the
minor payment that Official 2 declared in his/her official interview) was detected by the
ITF nor provided by Official 2. Further inquiries carried out by the ITF on 6 July 2004 at
Pristina Airport Customs Offices and at Pristina Customs Services Headquarters,
disclosed that the merchandise did indeed enter the airport storage on 26 December 2003
and left on 15 March 2004. According to two staff members, the Company merchandise
was not confiscated based on a request from Customs. The ITF found that the Company
paid a total amount of €11,581.00 for VAT and Customs Duties.
21. On July 12th 2004, ITF Investigators interviewed Partner 4 confirmed that the first
requested amount was €32,000.00, which was later changed to the agreed sum of
€8,000.00. He/she added that he/she received a strange phone call from a staff member of
Airline 2 Pristina Office on 9 July 2004, advising him/her to urgently make contact with
Official 2 on his/her mobile telephone, because Official 2 urgently needed to speak with
Partner 4. According to Partner 4’s statement, he/she called Official 2, who asked for an
appointment in order to discuss “a certain issue”. Partner 4 said he/she replied that there
was no need to continue this conversation, as he/she knew that Official 2 was trying to
influence any statements by Partner 4 that he/she may provide to any future inquiries
from an investigative body. Partner 4 stated to the ITF that he/she advised the staff
member of Airline 2 of his already scheduled appointment with ITF Investigators on the
following Monday and that he/she was prepared to tell all he knew on the matter. In view
of all the collected data and evidence, the ITF decided to refer the case to the Department
of Justice.

Investigation Task Force
Alleged Irregularities Related to an UNMIK Bank Account 1110019243020132-1
(Case No. 0221/04)
I. INTRODUCTION
1. The Investigation Task Force (ITF) Kosovo conducted an investigation into
the circumstances surrounding a UNMIK Bank Account opened at a Bank in
Pristina. This investigation was triggered by a forensic audit report of Public
Enterprise Airport Pristina (PEAP) released in February 2003 by the
Chartered Accountants.
2. The activities of the Pristina Airport fall under the control of the Kosovo Trust
Agency (KTA) and UNMIK Pillar IV, which is administered by the European
Union. Investigations into allegations of fraud and corruption involving
UNMIK, its pillars and other organizational structures as well as the
Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) and independent bodies
and offices established pursuant to the Constitutional Framework for
Provisional Self-Government in Kosovo fall within the purview of ITF as laid
out by the Executive Decision on the Establishment of the Investigation Task
Force UNMIK/ED/2003/16, dated 21 October 2003.
II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS:
3. Pursuant to the authority given to The Special Representative of the
Secretary-General, under United Nations Security Council resolution 1244
(1999) of 10 June 1999, taking into account United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) Regulation No. 1999/1 of 25 July
1999 on the Authority of the Interim Administration in Kosovo, for the
purpose of defining the law applicable in Kosovo, the SRSG promulgated that
the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:
a. The regulations promulgated by the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General and subsidiary instruments issued thereunder; and
b. The law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.
4. The ITF Investigators considered possible breaches of the Provisional
Criminal Code of Kosovo, especially Article 339 (Abusing Official Position of
Authority); Article 340 (Misappropriation in Office) and Article 341 (Fraud in
Office).
1 -3III. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
5. The DCDM Audit Report 2002/3 highlighted a possible problem with a
UNMIK Bank Account, which has been termed the “Company Account”. It
was alleged that there was only one signatory to this account (Staff Member 1)
and that the interest from this account was going to an unidentified private
account.
IV. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS
6. The ITF Investigators established that on 13 and 20 July 2001, UNMIK and the
Company signed a contract “Relating to the Supply of Aviation Fuel and the
Refuelling of Commercial Civilian Aircraft at Pristina Airport”. As of 03 March
2004, this Contract was amended, so that the Company also commenced
supplying aviation fuel and refuelling services to military and non-
commercial aircrafts.
7. Based on this contract, the Company has been making payments to UNMIK
that are being deposited to an UNMIK Bank Subject Account, opened at a
Bank in Pristina. This is a sub-account of the main UNMIK Bank Account.
8. The Bank Account was opened with the Bank on 11 October 2001 and the first
payment was made by way of an incoming International Money Transfer
(IMT) in the sum of € 45,105.23 on 17 April 2002. The most recent payment
made to this account was made on 24 January 2005 by the Company in the
sum of € 8,578.42. The actual balance on this bank account as of 04 March 2005
is € 537,536.90.
9. Initially Staff Member 1, was the “A” signatory of this account. On 14 July
2004, his/her Supervisor, formally notified Staff Member 2, that he/she was
an “A” signatory to this account with Staff Member 3 and Staff Member 4
being “B” signatories. Staff Member 2 was also notified that withdrawals from
this account could not be made without the joint approval of either the
Supervisor, Staff Member 5 or Staff Member 6. Staff Member 2 was also
informed that the Account was currently an UNMIK Bank Account and that
Pristina Airport did not have full control over the use of this account.
10.The ITF Investigators found no evidence that funds deposited in this UNMIK
Bank Account were generated by illegal activities. In fact this investigation
confirmed that all funds deposited on this account were generated by a
legitimate business sanctioned by a contract between UNMIK and the
Company.
11.The allegation that had been made by the Chartered Accountants - “interest
from this account was going to an unidentified private account” was found to be
without merit, given that the terms and conditions this UNMIK Bank Account
does not generate any interest. The ITF Investigators further established that
there were no withdrawals from this Account; the only debits were a variety
of bank charges.
2 -312.The ITF Investigation identified a long running dispute related to the legal
ownership of the money deposited to this UNMIK Bank Account. The funds
deposited to this account are being generated exclusively from the Pristina
Airport through a contract between UNMIK and Air BP. Despite numerous
inquiries that have been made by the Pristina Airport General Services
Department, no definitive answer has been provided as to who is the owner
of this money. As a result, a sum of € 537,536.90 is “sitting” in this UNMIK
Account and it does not generate any interest payments. It should be noted
that the Pristina Airport now has to borrow money to run its day-to-day
operations. This situation would suggest that the UNMIK Senior
Management team should resolve the legal ownership question as soon as
possible.
V. CONCLUSIONS
13.The investigation conducted by the ITF established that allegations made by
the Chartered Accountants in their Audit Report 2002/3 related to the
UNMIK Bank Subject Account were without merit. The ITF investigation
clearly proved that the funds deposited on this Subject UNMIK Bank Account
were generated by a legitimate business sanctioned by a valid contract
between UNMIK and the Air BP. None of the deposited money has been
withdrawn and the only debits to this account were a variety of bank charges.
14.The ITF did not find evidence that would indicate any illegalities related to
this UNMIK Bank Account. Staff Member 1 was an “A” signatory to this
Account as well to a number of other UNMIK Bank Accounts. Upon his/her
departure from Kosovo, the right of ”A” signatory for this account (and other
UNMIK Bank Accounts) was formally transferred to other authorised
individuals.
15.The ITF Investigation identified a long lasting problem related to legal
ownership of the funds deposited in this UNMIK Bank Account that should
be addressed and resolved as soon as possible.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 01: UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should, without any further
delay, resolve the dispute over the legal ownership of the Subject UNMIK Bank
Account. (IV04/221/01).
Recommendation 02: UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should explore the possibility to
deposit funds that are currently in the Subject UNMIK Bank Account to a
different account that would generate interest or use the funds for other
legitimate UNMIK operations. (IV04/221/02)

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
ID CASE NO. 0425/04
07 February 2006ALLEGATIONS OF MISMANAGEMENT AND WASTE OF RESOURCES BY
THE OFFICER OF THE UNMIL FUEL CELL
I. INTRODUCTION
1. During an assessment mission to the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL),
Investigators of the Investigations Division of the Office of Internal Oversight Services
(ID/OIOS) received information that Officer 1, formerly with the UNMIL Fuel Cell, was
unable to account for US$500,000 in fuel expenses for the month of February 2004. At
the time, no further details were provided to ID/OIOS regarding how the complainant
was aware of the fact that the Fuel Cell was unable to account for the US$500,000, nor in
what way Officer 1 was involved with the matter.
2. As a result of the investigation by ID/OIOS into the allegation against Officer 1, it
was determined that although it was true that an audit by Internal Audit Division 1 of
OIOS (IAD1/OIOS) had discovered that, for the period 1 August 2003 to 31 March 2004,
290,066 gallons of fuel (valued at US$455,404) could not be accounted for by UNMIL,
there was no evidence suggesting that Officer 1 was personally responsible for the
discrepancy.
II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
3. UNMIL was established on 19 September 2003 by Security Council Resolution
1509. Officer 1 was responsible for establishing the UNMIL Fuel Cell at the start of the
mission, having previously served as an Officer with the Mission des Nations Unies au
République Démocratique de Congo (MONUC). During the time he served as an officer
of the UNMIL Fuel Cell, the unit consisted of himself and 20 other staff members (four
International staff and the remainder National staff). Officer 1 left UNMIL and the
United Nations on 30 June 2004. His replacement, Officer 2, took over the post on 8 July
2004.
4. In January and February 2004 an audit of “Fuel Management in UNMIL”
(Reference AP2004/626/05) was conducted by IAD1/OIOS.
III. APPLICABLE LEGAL NORMS
Staff Regulation 1.2
(b): “Staff members shall uphold the highest standards of … integrity. The concept of
integrity includes … impartiality, fairness, honesty … in all matters affecting their work
and status.”
1(q): “Staff members shall use the property and assets of the Organization only for official
purposes and shall exercise reasonable care when utilizing such property and assets”
ST/IC/1996/29
Mismanagement
“(i) Any unreasonable failure of a staff member to perform efficiently, competently and
with the best interests of the Organization in mind, all assigned tasks, duties and
management responsibilities in connection with United Nations programmes and its
operations”
Waste of resources
“(i) Any unreasonable failure to ensure that the monetary or other resources of the
Organization are used solely, efficiently and effectively for the purposes of the
Organization or for its benefit;
(ii) Any unreasonable act or failure to act, which, as a direct result of a failure to
exercise due care, causes loss to the Organization”
IV. METHODOLOGY
5. ID/OIOS conducted interviews with all parties concerned, other than Officer 1
himself, and reviewed all relevant documentation.
V. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS
IAD1/OIOS Audit AP2004/626/05 “Fuel Management in UNMIL”
6. Prior to travelling to Liberia to investigate the allegations against Officer 1,
ID/OIOS reviewed the IAD1/OIOS audit report. Amongst other matters raised in the
report, IAD1/OIOS noted that, for the period 1 August 2003 to 31 March 2004, 290,066
gallons of fuel (valued at US$455,404) could not be accounted for. The Auditors noted
that there had been an investigation by UNMIL’s Special Investigation Unit (SIU) into
allegations that UNMIL fuel was being sold by bowser drivers to third parties and that
the investigation had concluded that there was credible evidence against some of the
bowser drivers and their supervisor. As a result of the investigation, the supervisor and
the drivers involved were dismissed. Since the supervisor in question was the one
responsible for the monitoring of deliveries and the completion of bowser log sheets,
IAD1/OIOS concluded that “irregularities in the distribution” could account for the
290,066-gallon discrepancy.
27. The IAD/OIOS Auditors made a total of 17 recommendations to UNMIL
regarding the way that the mission managed fuel. The mission accepted all but one of the
recommendations (this recommendation was subsequently withdrawn by IAD-1/OIOS)
and has implemented them.
SIU Investigation SIU/MON/0090/04
8. Upon receipt of information on 13 March 2004 that UNMIL bowser drivers were
selling UNMIL fuel to local vendors in Monrovia and other parts of Liberia, the SIU
initiated an investigation into the allegations. The SIU investigation revealed that some
locally hired drivers, employed to deliver fuel to various UNMIL installations, were
selling a portion of the fuel they were transporting to local vendors. The SIU found that
the theft and sale of UNMIL fuel was organised by the drivers’ supervisor and that it had
begun soon after the mission commenced in 2003. As a result of the investigation, the
supervisor and the drivers identified by the SIU were dismissed. There was no evidence
disclosed during the SIU investigation to suggest that Officer 1 was in any way involved
in the theft and subsequent re-sale of the fuel.
ID/OIOS Investigation
9. The original complainant in the case was interviewed by ID/OIOS. He stated that
he had no personal knowledge of either the problems with the Fuel Cell accounts or of
any involvement of Officer 1 in the problems identified. He claimed that he had become
aware, as a result of his position in the mission, that an audit was being conducted into
the Fuel Cell accounts and that an amount of approximately US$500,000 could not be
accounted for. This was the information that he had communicated to ID/OIOS, along
with the fact that Officer 1 was an Officer of the Fuel Cell at the time. The complainant
was unable to provide any further information to ID/OIOS about the matter under
investigation.
10. The current situation regarding the UNMIL Fuel Cell and fuel management
within UNMIL has been investigated under ID/OIOS Case 0430/04 and was not revisited
during this investigation.
VI. FINDINGS
11. The original complainant, when re-interviewed by ID/OIOS, was not able to
provide any concrete evidence to suggest that Officer 1 was in any way responsible for
the US$500,000 discrepancy in the Fuel Cell accounts. Indeed, he stated that he had
never mentioned the exact amount involved and that Officer 1’s name had only come up
because Officer 1 was the Officer of the Fuel Cell at the time.
12. Officer 1 is no longer with the United Nations and therefore no longer falls under
the authority of OIOS.
313. The discrepancy mentioned to ID/OIOS by the complainant did exist but it had
already been noted by the IAD-1/OIOS Auditors who, in their final report, suggested that
the missing fuel could most probably be attributed to the actions of the former fuel
supervisor and the bowser drivers. These persons were dismissed from the mission once
their actions became known.
14. UNMIL has acted on the recommendations of the IAD/OIOS Auditors and, as
demonstrated by the results of the investigation into ID/OIOS Case 0430/04, the situation
regarding fuel management in the mission is much improved.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
15. The evidence as disclosed during this investigation demonstrates that the
allegations against Officer 1 cannot be substantiated.
VIII. RECOMMENDATION
16. In view of the findings of this investigation:
Recommendation 1: It is recommended that DPKO record this case as unsubstantiated,
and that Officer 1 is advised that he is cleared of any wrongdoing as to these allegations.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
ID CASE NO. 0050/05
4 March 2005Report of Investigation – ID Case 0050/05
I. INTRODUCTION
1. On 13 February 2005, the Investigations Division of the Office of Internal
Oversight Services (ID/OIOS) received a request from UNON Official 1 to inquire
into allegations that locally recruited United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON) staff
may have engaged in improper conduct by submitting fraudulent letters of
appointments showing longer contract duration dates to obtain loans from the United
Nations Co-operative Savings and Credit Society Limited (UN-SACCO), which
operates within UNON premises.
2. The request was prompted by an earlier report submitted to UNON
Management by UNON Official 2, on a scheme whereby locally recruited staff
members from the Nairobi-based United Nations Children’s Fund/Somalia Support
Centre (UNICEF/Somalia) obtained UN-SACCO loans by submitting fraudulent
letters of appointments to UN-SACCO. The primary concern of UNON Management
was that a similar fraudulent scheme might have spread to UNON and other Nairobi-
based United Nations Agencies.
3. At the time of the request, two ID/OIOS Investigators were on mission to
Nairobi on another matter, but given the concerns expressed by UNON Managers, the
ID/OIOS Investigators were directed by ID/OIOS Management to look into this
matter with celerity, and did so, from 14 through 18 February 2005.
4. The purpose of this report is to present the findings of the preliminary
ID/OIOS Investigation together with recommendations for appropriate action by
UNON Management.
II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
A. UN-SACCO
5. According to information provided in a leaflet, (Attachment 1), UN-SACCO
was created in 1975, “to establish a forum for United Nations staff in Kenya to save
their disposable income and borrow at minimal cost to meet their socio-economic
needs.” At present, UN-SACCO has a capital of US $ 13.5 million with about 2,500
members, and is managed by a Management Committee elected at an annual General
Meeting of the Society on a renewable three-year term.
6. In order to become a UN-SACCO member, a staff member of the United
Nations completes an “Application for Membership” form (Attachment 2) and pays a
fee of Kshs. 500 (about US $ 7). UN-SACCO members own shares and can request
and obtain individual loans after holding membership in UN-SACCO for six months.
Members may apply for a loan up to three times the value of their shares. The length
of the loans cannot extend beyond the term of employment by the United Nations.
17. To obtain an individual loan, a staff member is required to complete either a
“Loan Application & Loan Agreement Form” (Attachment 3) or an “Instant Loan
Facility Application & Agreement Form” (Attachment 4). The staff member must
attach to his/her request documents including copies of his/her latest payslip, National
Identification Card or Passport and a copy of his/her letter of contract.
8. A copy of the letter of contract is required to ensure that the applicant holds a
valid contract, which covers the agreed period of time for the repayment of the loan.
The benefit of a longer contract is that it permits repayment in lesser amounts over a
longer period of time.
9. To ensure guarantee of repayment, the applicant must provide up to six
guarantors in the event of the borrower’s default. The guarantors must also be UN-
SACCO members.
10. The applications for loans are reviewed by UN-SACCO staff and a Credit
Committee, which approve, defer, or reject the application.
B. UNICEF/Somalia Fraud
11. On 10 February 2005, while settling the separation payment of a former
locally recruited UNICEF/Somalia staff member, an Administrative Officer who
worked on the matter noted that the staff member had borrowed a large amount of
money from UN-SACCO in January 2004 and that at the time of his/her separation
s/he still owed UN-SACCO about one-third of the amount borrowed.
12. The Administrative Officer learned from UN-SACCO management that the
loan was granted based upon a letter of appointment submitted to UN-SACCO by that
staff member, which showed that his/her contract would be renewed through 31
December 2006. However, the contract was actually only from 1 January 2004 to 31
December 2004.
13. The Administrative Officer requested a copy of the appointment letter and
found that it was fraudulent, in that the date of the expiration of the contract was false
and the signature of a UNICEF Operations Officer named in the letter was forged.
Upon further inquiries from UN-SACCO managers, UNICEF/Somalia Management
started an inquiry and found that other UNICEF/Somalia staff members had obtained
similarly improper loans. UNICEF/Somalia has only approximately 20 staff members.
14. The results of this inquiry were described in a “Report on the preliminary
investigation of a case of fraudulent signatures and use of office stationary and
official seal – UNICEF Somalia, Nairobi”, dated 11 February 2005, which included
copies of the false letters of appointment and written statements of several locally
recruited UNICEF staff who admitted their improper conduct. (Attachment 5)
III. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS
C. Interviews with UNICEF staff
215. Upon request from ID/OIOS, UNICEF Management agreed to cooperate with
the ID/OIOS inquiry by providing access to its files and staff members involved in the
fraud. However, UNICEF Management insisted, and ID/OIOS agreed, that ID/OIOS
interviews of their staff be conducted at UNICEF premises and in the presence of two
Senior UNICEF Managers. The objectives of these interviews by ID/OIOS were to
confirm and/or rule out involvement by UNON staff members in similar cases and to
obtain information to ensure that UNON management safeguard mechanisms to avoid
similar occurrences at UNON.
16. ID/OIOS could not interview all UNICEF staff or former staff involved in the
fraud. For example, one staff member passed away and another, who had left
UNICEF, declined the interview. In addition, the UNICEF inquiry was not final and
information obtained primarily through the interviews of UNICEF staff by ID/OIOS
suggested that there might be more UNICEF staff involved than initially envisaged.
17. During their interviews with ID/OIOS, the concerned UNICEF staff confirmed
that they misused UNICEF letterhead and official seal, indicated that they forged the
signature of a UNICEF Operations officer and that they provided UN-SACCO with
incorrect information about the duration of their contracts in order to obtain loans. All
of them mentioned the ease with which they accessed official UNICEF stamps,
stationeries and computers, although given the limited responsibilities of some of
them, for example, the drivers, such access should not have occurred.
18. Further, most interviewees stated that they acted alone and, with one
exception, all denied that either their UNICEF or UNON colleagues assisted them in
their fraudulent activities or had been otherwise aware of or involved in such
improper actions.
D. Interviews with UN-SACCO and UNON staff
19. UN-SACCO and UNON staff members interviewed by the ID/OIOS
Investigators provided general information about their operations and otherwise
cooperated with the ID/OIOS inquiry by providing unhindered access to their files.
However, these interviews did not produce conclusive information to either suggest or
completely rule out improper conduct on the part of UNON staff members.
E. Additional Investigative steps
20. Documentation obtained from UN-SACCO shows that about 2,500 staff
members from UNON and other United Nations related organizations have requested
and obtained UN-SACCO loans, about one thousand of whom are UNON staff. Given
the large number of records to review, which would then need to be compared to
similar records from UNON, and the absence of any identified subjects, the ID/OIOS
Investigators decided to do a thorough review of a sampling of cases. Files were
selected for review where the loan amount was high, the duration of the contract long,
or the applicant was also a guarantor on other loans.
21. Further, whenever the ID/OIOS Investigators noted apparent irregularities
concerning letters of appointments or other similar documents produced by these staff
to UN-SACCO, for example letters suggesting that their contracts would be renewed
3beyond the expiration date of their contracts, the ID/OIOS officers made copies of
those documents and compared them with the corresponding documentation available
in the Official Status Files of those staff and/or confirmed with UNON officials
whose signatures appeared on those letters that they had indeed signed them.
22. The ID/OIOS Investigators noted with concern that in January 2005, one
Senior UNEP Manager had informed UN-SACCO management that the contract of a
particular staff member is likely to be extended for a further two years, subject to
satisfactory performance. During the manager’s interview with ID/OIOS, s/he
admitted s/he had written a letter at the request of the staff member and advised that
such letters are sometimes provided to UN-SACCO so that locally recruited staff can
obtain loans. ID/OIOS cautions managers that the issuance of these letters may give
the impression that a staff member’s contract will be renewed.
23. In this regard, it should be noted that most, if not all letters of appointments
issued by the Organization, provide that fixed-term appointments do not carry any
expectation of renewal or of conversion to any other type of appointment and expire
automatically and without prior notice on the expiration date specified in the letter of
appointment.
24. This position is consistent with the jurisprudence of the United Nations
Administrative Tribunal (UNAT), which has established that good performance by a
staff member does not by itself create any legitimate expectation for renewal of any
fixed-term contract (see Judgement 562 dated 2 July 1993).
IV. FINDINGS
25. Given the absence of concrete information concerning improper conduct by
UNON staff, and based upon the review of a limited number of UN-SACCO and
UNON files, ID/OIOS finds that, while there is evidence of improper conduct on the
part of some UNICEF staff members in obtaining loans from UN-SACCO, there is no
evidence that such similar improper conduct also occurred at UNON.
26. In fact, as noted above, rather than producing information about possible
involvement of UNON staff in a similar fraud, the interviews of UNICEF/Somalia
staff yielded more information about further possible UNICEF subjects involved in
the same type of fraud, who had either not been identified in the UNICEF preliminary
inquiry or had not been interviewed. Moreover, these interviews also suggested
possible improper conduct by one UNICEF manager, who may have contributed to
the fraud by providing a letter, which suggested that the contract of one staff would be
extended further beyond its normal term.
427. The review of likely candidates for such frauds (i.e., those with large loans and
long contracts) did not produce a single instance of fraud. However, ID/OIOS cannot
exclude the possibility that locally recruited UNON staff members have submitted
fraudulent letters to UN-SACCO to obtain loans, as had their UNICEF colleagues.
Without concrete leads or a thorough review of all of the numerous files of the UNON
staff members who have obtained UN-SACCO loans, it is not possible to rule out
similar fraudulent schemes undertaken by UNON staff.
28. ID/OIOS noted with concern the ease with which locally recruited UNICEF
staff, such as drivers, obtained access to official UNICEF stamps, stationeries and
computers. UNON should ensure that there are adequate controls in place to prevent
such abuses in UNON.
29. Further, while analysing the fraudulent scheme at UNICEF/Somalia, ID/OIOS
noted that when requests for letters of appointment suggesting contract renewal were
denied, staff members produced fraudulent letters of appointment which were
accepted by UN-SACCO management, although they were clearly different in style
and format from legitimate letters.
30. Furthermore, as noted above, in one case detected by ID/OIOS a letter of
appointment, which stated that renewal for two years was subject to satisfactory
performance, was provided to a UNON staff member. Such a letter, even from one
with the authority to do so, is improper, may be used to demonstrate a staff member’s
“right” to a renewal, and should stop immediately.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
31. In light of the foregoing, ID/OIOS offers the following recommendations,
which could reduce the risk of the occurrences of similar fraudulent activities as the
one described in this report:
Recommendation 1: It is recommended that UNON Management inform UN-
SACCO Management that henceforth they should require original official UNON
documentation from UNON staff members, and any suspicions about the veracity of
such documentation should be promptly reported to UNON and the authenticity of
those documents verified. (ID Rec. No. IV05/050/01)
Recommendation 2: It is recommended that UNON ascertain if its personnel officers
are aware of instances of staff members requesting letters or documentation averring
that their contracts would be renewed beyond their expiration dates, and such requests
were denied. If so, UNON Management should liaise with UN-SACCO Management
to determine whether such staff members then submitted fraudulent documentation to
obtain loans. (ID Rec. No. IV05/050/02)
Recommendation 3: It is recommended that UNON Management ensure that its
official UNON seals/stamps are placed in secured places and are used solely by
authorized UNON officials to prevent the risk of their misuse by other persons. (ID
Rec. IV05/050/03)
5Recommendation 4: It is recommended that UNON Management requests UN-
SACCO Management to systematically confirm with UNON Personnel offices any
information related to employment duration provided to them by UNON staff
members. (ID Rec. IV05/050/04)

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
ID CASE NO. 0575/03
27 April 2005Investigation into the allegation that a UNON/ITS staff member obtained money from
UNPOS on the promise that s/he would facilitate the installation of the New York tie-line
connection to the RSG residence.
(ID/OIOS Case No. 0575/03)
I. INTRODUCTION
1. In October 2003, the Investigations Division of Office of Internal Oversight Services
(ID/OIOS) received information that in May 2003 UNON/ITS Staff Member, a staff member in
the Information Technology Service of the United Nations Office in Nairobi (UNON/ITS),
solicited and obtained Ksh 22,250 (US$294.70) with the promise to extend a New York tie-line
satellite connection from the United Nations Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS) to the
residence of the Representative of the Secretary General. Given the low priority of this case, it
was investigated when time and resources permitted. The investigation is now complete.
II. APPLICABLE LAW
Staff Regulation 1.2
(b) Staff members shall uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence
and integrity. The concept of integrity includes, but is not limited to, probity,
impartiality, fairness, honesty and truthfulness in all matters affecting their work
and status…
Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, ST/SGB/2003/7 of 9 May 2003
A. Rule 101.2 “All United Nations staff are obligated to comply with the
Financial Regulations and Rules and with administrative instructions issued in
connection with those Regulations and Rules. Any staff member who contravenes
the Financial Regulations and Rules or corresponding administrative instructions
may be held personally accountable and financially liable for his or her actions.”
C. Regulation 5.12: Procurement functions include all the actions necessary
for the acquisition, by purchase or lease, of property, including, all products and
real property, and of services, including works. The following general principles
shall be given due consideration when exercising the procurement functions of the
United Nations:
a) Best value for money;
b) Fairness, integrity and transparency;
c) Effective international competition;
d) The interests of the United Nations.III. METHODOLOGY
3. ID/OIOS reviewed documents relevant to the investigation and researched pertinent
United Nations rules and regulations as well as local laws. ID/OIOS also interviewed witnesses
in UNON, UNPOS and UNDP offices in Nairobi.
IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
4. UNPOS is a mission set up by the Department of Political Affairs (DPA) and is headed
by a Representative of the Secretary General (RSG). UNPOS is based at the UNON compound
in Gigiri, Kenya and receives common services support from UNON.
V. INVESTGATIVE DETAILS
5. ID/OIOS interviewed various members of the UNPOS staff who provided the following
information. The UNPOS Official wished to extend the New York tie-line satellite connection
from the RSG office to the RSG residence. His/her staff located the UNON/ITS Staff Member who
said s/he could provide the connection with the purchase of a few items of equipment. UNPOS
requested, on 15 May 2003, that a cheque for Kshs 22,250 be issued to the UNON/ITS Staff
Member for this purpose, which s/he cashed. However, s/he never provided the service, nor did
s/he return the money when asked. On 27 August 2003 the UNPOS Official’s administrative
assistant made a formal request to the UNON Official for the installation and on 7 October 2003
a letter from UNPOS signed by the UNPOS Official to the UNON Official alleged that the
UNON/ITS Staff Member had promised this service, received payment but had not provided the
service or returned the money.
6. ID/OIOS interviewed the UNON/ITS Staff Member, who claimed that his/her verbal
proposal to UNPOS was that s/he would prepare the equipment for the satellite link, but that
installation was to be carried out by a licensed company. S/he said that the payment to him/her
was only for preparation of the equipment. S/he explained that his/her advice that the satellite
connection was possible was based on his/her projected use of required equipment that was lying
unused in the UNON workshop. However, s/he did not get approval for the use of this
equipment at the time of his/her proposal from his/her supervisor, the UNON Official, who was
on leave. When s/he did speak to the UNON Official, s/he was told that the equipment could not
be used by UNPOS and that UNPOS should initiate a procurement procedure for the job or
arrange to purchase and install the equipment itself. The UNON/ITS Staff Member gave this
information to the UNPOS Official’s administrative assistant. S/he told ID/OIOS that s/he was
willing to refund the money, but had not done so.
7. ID/OIOS interviewed the UNON Official. S/he stated that upon receipt of the formal
request for installation of the satellite link, s/he informed UNPOS that the equipment required
would cost $11,560. S/he told ID/OIOS that the proper procedure to obtain this link required
UNPOS to make a formal request to his/her office and, after its approval, a procurement process
would take place. Due to limitations of staff and a lack of licensing authority, UNON/IT couldplay an advisory role, but the company that won the bid would provide equipment and
installation.
8. The UNON Official also told ID/OIOS said s/he had not known of the UNON/ITS Staff
Member’s initiative until after s/he received UNPOS’ formal request for the satellite link. After
receipt of the UNPOS Official’s letter of 7 October 2003, s/he referred the matter to the UNON
Security and Safety Unit for investigation.
VI. FINDINGS
9. UNPOS attempted to achieve an extension of the satellite link from its office to the
residence of the RSG. A verbal arrangement was made with the UNON/ITS Staff Member and
payment arranged for him/her of Ksh 22,250.
10. While the UNON/ITS Staff Member claimed that s/he told UNPOS that s/he was using
the money to purchase equipment to repair a power supply for the project and that installation
would have to be carried out by a licensed company, UNPOS’ claim that the agreement was that
the UNON/ITS Staff Member was to handle the entire project for this sum is supported by the
evidence.
11. The UNON/ITS Staff Member had intended to use expensive equipment from the UNON
workshop, but did not receive permission to do so from his/her supervisor prior to his/her
arrangement with UNPOS. When the UNON Official learned of these arrangements, s/he told
the UNON/ITS Staff Member the equipment could not be used by UNPOS and that a request for
extension of the satellite link must go though the proper channels.
12. UNPOS did not receive an extension of its satellite link to the residence and the
UNON/ITS Staff Member did not return the money paid him/her.
VII. CONCLUSION
13. By personally undertaking to extend the satellite link to the RSG residence, receiving
money for said undertaking, failing to provide the satellite link and refusing to return the money
paid to him/her, the UNON/ITS Staff Member acted contrary to his/her obligations under Staff
Regulation 1.2
14. By personally undertaking to extend the satellite link to the RSG residence, the
UNON/ITS Staff Member acted contrary to his/her obligations under The Financial Regulations
and Rules of the United Nations ST/SGB/2003/7, Regulation 5.12.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS

Investigation Task Force
Investigation into allegations of irregularities in two tender processes for the
supply of cleaning machines to Pristina Airport. (Case 0280/04)
I. INTRODUCTION
1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28 February 2003 into the financial
statements of Pristina International Airport conducted by the Chartered
Accountants which led to an investigation concerning alleged corruption and
irregularities arising in the course of procurements and contracts at Pristina
International Airport.
2. There are two specific allegations in this report of investigation:
• no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by
companies submitting bids in the first tender;
• tender specifications for both tenders the cleaning machines were taken from the
brochure of one of the companies submitting a tender, thereby giving it an unfair
advantage in the tender process.
II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS
PROCEDURAL RULES
Section 1 of UNMIK Regulation 1999/24 dated 12 December 1999 as amended,
states that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:
a) “The regulations promulgated by the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General (SRSG) and subsidiary instruments issued pursuant to
those regulations; and
b) The Law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.”
UN Staff Regulations 1.2 (b) stipulates “Staff members shall uphold the highest
standards of efficiency, competence and integrity”
UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using
Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds provides that:
Article 4 1 – “Competition among and participation in the procurement process
shall be maximised.”
Article 4.1.1 – “All Suppliers and Contractors and their tenders shall be treated
fairly, equally, and non-discriminatorily, without favouritism or prejudice and each
Tender shall be judged on its merits.”
Article 4.3.3. – “If a consultant or any principal, officer or employee of such
consultant has participated or will participate in any manner in the preparation of2
the UNMIK Kosovo Interim Administration’s Tendering for a contract, including
but not limited to preparations of specifications or any other Tender Documents,
no such consultant nor any principal officer or employee of such consultant, no
“related person” nor any “illegal payer” may tender for or sponsor or participate in
the Tendering for such contract.”
Article 15 1 – “Technical specifications and descriptions of the Goods, Works, or
Services to be procured shall be carefully prepared to foster fair and open
competition among all suppliers.”
Article 15.4 – “There shall be no requirements or reference in the technical
specifications to a particular trademark, brand name, patent, design, type, origin,
producer or service provider unless (a) there is no sufficiently precise or
intelligible way of describing the procurement requirements and (b) qualifying
words, such as “or equivalent” are included in such requirement or reference.”
Staff Rule 110.1: Misconduct. “Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her
obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and the
Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances, or to observe the standards of
conduct expected of an international civil servant, may amount to unsatisfactory
conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2, leading to the institution of
disciplinary measures for misconduct.”
I. METHODOLOGY
3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on
the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators
conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons
indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by
obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV,
which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.
II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
4. Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under
Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal
buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period
covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the
Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the
Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution
1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999.
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned
and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.
5. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina
Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,
including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport
and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport
Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left
UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an3
international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations,
reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001.
Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from the
armed forces of a United Nations member state, specifically Airport Engineer 1,
Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3 and later by the Consultant from the
Consulting Firm.
6. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed
from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional
Manager was appointed to the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under him
were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official 1.
7. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been
under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under
ICAO regulations.
8. It is against this background of change that procurement procedures relating to
the following contract have been examined.
III. INVESTIGATION DETAILS
9. This part of the investigation relates to two tenders for a contract, for the supply
of cleaning machines at Pristina Airport. The value of the contract was
€180,816.00.
Allegation 1
(It is alleged that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due to the fact that no
proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by
companies submitting bids in the first tender)
10. A bid evaluation report drawn up by the Procurement Officer, dated 18 April
2003, identifies that bids were opened in an evaluation process to select a
company to supply cleaning machines to Pristina Airport on 18 April 2003.
However, a notification letter from the PEAP Official and the KTA Divisional
Manager to the companies participating in the tender exercise dated 6 June 2003
confirms that this tender was cancelled.
11. When asked about the reason for the cancellation, the Procurement Officer 1
stated to the ITF that the technical specifications for the first tender were taken
from a catalogue of a certain producer, which offered those machines, as a result
of which it predetermined the winner. He/she added that machinery specified was
of the most expensive type. (See below allegation 2)
12. The Maintenance Official and Member of the Evaluation Committee, when asked
the same question, stated that the first tender was cancelled due to the fact that
the Procurement Officer 1 indicated there had been no proper description of the
cabins for the cleaning machines in the bids submitted. However, he/she added
that from his/her knowledge at least two of the companies had included a proper
description of the cabins in their bid documents.4
13. An Engineer at the Pristina Airport, told the ITF that the Airport requested
cleaning machines with cabins in order that cleaning could be carried out in
different weather conditions. However, the bidders did not include the cabin in
their bids. He/she did not indicate that two bidders included a proper description
in their bid documents.
14. In the light of the evidence provided, and detailed below, the ITF does not find
that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due to the fact that no proper
description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by companies
submitting bids in the first tender.
Allegation 2
First tender
(It is alleged that tender specifications for both tenders the cleaning machines were
taken from the brochure of one of the companies submitting a tender, thereby giving
it an unfair advantage in the tender process)
15. The person responsible for drawing up the specifications for the both tenders was
the Engineer at the Pristina Airport, who confirmed in interview that he/she had
been asked to draw up the specifications by the Member of the Evaluation
Committee. He/she also confirmed that the Member of the Evaluation Committee
provided him with signed photocopies from the brochure of Vendor 1 in order to
assist him in drawing up the specifications. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport
added that he/she used them as a basis for the technical specifications. The ITF
located a draft of an undated handwritten note from the Engineer at the Pristina
Airport to the KTA Divisional Manager, which confirms that he/she used the
photocopies from the brochure to assist him in drawing up the technical
specifications for the cleaning machines. The Member of the Evaluation
Committee confirmed to the ITF that he/she handed the signed pages to the
Engineer at the Pristina Airport to assist in the preparation of the technical
specifications for the cleaning machines.
16. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport and the Member of the Evaluation Committee
were asked in interview whether they were aware of the provision of Article 15 of
Financial Administration Instruction No. 2/1999, and in particular Articles 15.1 and
15.4. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport indicated that he/she worked on the
general principle set out in Article 15.1, but had not seen Article 15.4; whilst the
Chairman of the Evaluation Committee appeared to be ignorant of Article 15
altogether.
Second tender
17. A bid evaluation report dated 30 June 2003 indicates that a second tender
exercise was undertaken following the cancellation of the first one.
18. Pristina Airport Procurement Officer 2 in the second tender indicated that
although Procurement Officer 1 published the tender, Procurement Officer 2 did
the bid opening and was the Member of the Evaluation Committee. This is
confirmed in a memorandum from Procurement Officer 2 to the PEAP Official5
dated 9 July 2003, which identifies the evaluation committee members and in an
ITF interview with Procurement Officer 2, the PEAP Official did not refer to
Procurement Officer 2 or the second tender evaluation committee in his/her
interview.
19. Procurement Officer 2 added that the evaluation committee chose Vendor 2.
However, after he/she had drafted the contract and letter of acceptance for
signature, he/she was instructed by the Airport management, although he/she did
not state by whom, to put it on hold until the technical evaluation committee and
airport management had organised a meeting with the Procurement Officer 1.
20. According to Procurement Officer 2, the reason for the meeting was due to
concerns that the winning bid was the second most expensive and doubts that
the technical specifications had given an unfair advantage to one company.
21. An examination of the technical evaluation report and Vendor 2’s bid
documentation suggests that the specification produced by Vendor 2 was very
similar to the specification requirement, although there is no evidence that it was
provided with the technical specifications in advance. In addition, Vendor 1, the
company from whose brochure the specifications were taken, did not submit a
bid.
22. An Internet search indicates Vendor 1 is the second largest producer of industrial
cleaning machines in one United Nations member state being founded in 1966. It
went into insolvency in 2002 and was bought by a multi-national company. An
Internet search of its directors does not indicate any connection with Vendor 2.
There is also no indication that Vendor 2 is connected to the multi-national
company.
23. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport, in interview with the ITF, also stated that the
evaluation committee had raised doubts as to whether it would be worthwhile
purchasing the cleaning machines, which whilst meeting the specification criteria,
came at a high price.
IV. FINDINGS OF FACT
24. The first tender for cleaning machines was cancelled due to alleged deficiencies
in the description of the cabins for the cleaning machines in the bids submitted
and the fact that a brochure from the Vendor 1 was used in the preparation of the
technical specifications for the cleaning machines. This gave rise to concerns that
the technical specifications had given an unfair advantage to one company,
namely Vendor 1.
25. The second tender was not awarded due to concerns that the technical
specifications produced from the brochure of Vendor 1 had given an unfair
advantage to one company; and doubts as to the high purchase cost of the
cleaning machines which met the specification criteria.6
V. CONCLUSIONS
26. On the available information, the decision leading to the cancellation of the first
tender was correct, since concerns had been raised concerning both the
descriptions of the machines to be purchased and the fact that a brochure from
Vendor 1 was used in the preparation of the technical specifications for the
cleaning machines. This gave rise to concerns that the technical specifications
had given an unfair advantage to one company in breach of Article 15.1 of
UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using
Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds.
27. The reasons for the second tender not proceeding appear to be well founded if
concerns were expressed over the offer price and the technical specification.
However, there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether in this instance, the
use of technical specifications from a particular company brochure was a
deliberate attempt to corrupt the tender process or due to ignorance of the
regulations.
VI. RECOMMENDATION
28. Based on the above information, the ITF recommends that UNMIK refer this
report to the D/SRSG Pillar IV for any action deemed appropriate with regard to
ensuring that staff involved in preparing tenders do not utilise technical
specifications that would give an unfair advantage to individual companies in the
course of subsequent tender exercises (IV04/280/01).","[('UNITED NATIONS NATIONS UNIES\nUnited Nations Interim Mission d’Administration Intérimaire\nAdministration Mission', 'ORG'), ('Kosovo', 'GPE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Pristina Airport', 'FAC'), ('28 February 2003', 'DATE'), ('Pristina International Airport', 'FAC'), ('the Chartered\nAccountants', 'ORG'), ('Pristina\nInternational Airport', 'FAC'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), (':', 'CARDINAL'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNITED NATIONS\nPROCEDURAL', 'ORG'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('12 December 1999', 'DATE'), ('Kosovo', 'GPE'), ('the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General (SRSG)', 'ORG'), ('The Law', 'DATE'), ('Kosovo', 'GPE'), ('22 March 1989', 'DATE'), (')', 'CARDINAL'), ('Public Procurement', 'ORG'), (':', 'CARDINAL'), ('4 1 –', 'DATE'), ('non-', 'ORG'), ('the United Nations', 'ORG'), ('the Investigation Task Force.

REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This is a report dealing with the matters raised (1) in the audit report
dated 26 January 2006 PD/155/02 and (2) raised in other referrals
concerning Mr. Walter Cabrera, procurement officer, Headquarters
Procurement Section, at relevant times.
The following sets forth the findings of the Procurement Task Force
concerning United Nations staff member Walter Cabrera.
INTRODUCTION
The Procurement Task Force was created on January 12, 2006 to
address all procurement matters referred to the Office of Internal Oversight
Services (OIOS). The creation of the Task Force was the result of perceived
problems in procurement identified by the Independent Inquiry Committee
into the Oil for Food Programme (IIC), and the arrest and conviction of UN
procurement officer Alexander Yakovlev.
Under its Terms of Reference, the Task Force operates as part of
OIOS, and reports directly to the Under Secretary General of OIOS. The
remit of the Task Force is to investigate all open and pending procurement
cases, including all matters involving the procurement bidding exercises,
procurement staff, and vendors doing business with the United Nations
(hereinafter “UN” or “Organization”). The mandate of the Task Force also
includes a review in some procurement matters which have been closed, but
it is nevertheless determined that further investigative effort is warranted.
The Task Force’s investigations have also focused upon a myriad of
individuals and vendors doing business with the Organization. Some of
these matters are particularly complex and span significant periods of time.
Since its inception, more than 200 matters, involving numerous procurement
cases in various UN Missions and UN Headquarters have been referred to
the Task Force. The Task Force will report on matters individually. The
Task Force has given priority to the matters involving the eight staff
members placed on special leave with pay.
The purpose of this report is to address the matters raised in the audit
findings of January 2006 concerning Walter Cabrera, a United Nations
procurement officer, and another matter brought to the attention of the Task
1OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE

Force through a separate referral. First, Mr. Cabrera is alleged to have
improperly provided notification to a prospective vendor that approval had
been granted in favor of the vendor, Thunderbird LLC (Thunderbird) for a
contract to provide manpower support in UN Missions, prior to the official
award of the contract. Secondly, the audit report found that Cabrera
engaged in misconduct in connection with the procurement exercises in
substantial contracts ultimately awarded to the firm Telecommunications
Consultants of India (TCIL). The audit report found significant fraud
indicators in connection with the procurement exercises in these contracts, a
conclusion with which the Task Force agrees. (The Task Force will report
on these issues in much more detail in a subsequent report addressing related
matters). However, the focus of this report is upon the conduct of Mr.
Cabrera individually, and whether Mr. Cabrera acted improperly in his
participation in these matters.
APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS
This matter is examined within the confines of the applicable United
Nations regulations and rules, and in particular, the following:
Rule 1.2(b) which requires Staff Members to “uphold the highest standards
of efficiency, competence, and integrity.” The regulations define the concept
of integrity to include, but not limited to, “probity, impartiality, fairness,
honesty and truthfulness in all matters affecting their work and status.”
Rule 1.2(i) which requires that Staff members “shall exercise the utmost
discretion with regard to all matters of official business. They shall not
communicate to any Government, entity, person or any other source any
information known to them by reason of their official position that they
know or ought to have known has been made public, except as appropriate
in the normal course of their duties or by authorization of the Secretary-
General.”
METHODOLOGY
The Task Force has examined the discussion and findings in the audit
report, and spoken with both the auditors responsible for the matter, and, on
several occasions, Mr. Cabrera. The Task Force has examined the file from
2OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE
REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
the procurement department (“PD”) in connection with the Thunderbird
matter, and the TCIL contracts. However, substantial portions of the files
concerning both of these cases were found to be missing. Nonetheless, the
Task Force has examined relevant email communication, electronically
stored records, and hard copy documents received through a variety of
sources. The Task Force has spoken with the officials in DPKO responsible
for requisition of the items underlying the contracts at issue, and other
United Nations procurement officers involved in these matters.
With regard to the TCIL contracts, the investigation of Mr. Cabrera’s
involvement in the laptop procurement, more fully discussed below, has
faced a number of significant challenges including the procurement
department’s policy of short term retention of cancelled bids and the
turnover and movement of staff. Nevertheless, forensic data recovery has
been an important tool utilized to examine the circumstances and the
relevant communication on the issue. In connection with the Thunderbird
matter, significant portions of the Thunderbird file are also missing. In that
case as well, the Task Force has been able to use forensic resources to gather
significant relevant information and evidence.
DISCUSSION
Notice of the Award to Thunderbird LLC
The facts of this matter as they relate to Mr. Cabrera are not in
dispute. In May, 2002, Thunderbird LLC (Thunderbird), through Mr.
Nishan Kohli, its Managing Partner, had submitted an application in support
of registering with the Organization as a vendor authorizing it to submit
proposals on upcoming UN contracts. In July, 2002, after successfully being
registered by PD, Thunderbird, through Nishan Kohli, submitted a proposal
for the supply of engineering manpower to various UN Missions in response
to the RFP issued by the Procurement Department. Ultimately, Mr. Sanjaya
Bahel, Chief of Field Procurement, had made a presentation to the
Headquarters Committee on Contracts (HCC) in favor of the award to
Thunderbird. The matter had not been assigned to Mr. Cabrera until late
December, 2002, and he was involved in the case only peripherally until that
time.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
However, after the presentation by Mr. Bahel to the HCC on 4
September 2002, the HCC granted expedited approval for an extension of
the existing contract being performed at the time by IECS-IRCON (“IECS”),
and a subsequent award to Thunderbird to replace IECS. The circumstances
surrounding the request for expedited approval and the basis for it are not
fully clear. There is no record of such a request, and there is no reference to
any such request in the minutes of the HCC. Mr. Cabrera has denied
making the request, and there is no information in the procurement
department’s files on the issue or to suggest Mr. Cabrera made the request.
However, it is clear that the request is required to come from the
procurement department, either the officer making the presentation, or the
supervisor. The line officer who attended the HCC meeting with Mr. Bahel
has denied making the request at any time, and there is not evidence to
suggest that she did.
However, the investigation has revealed Mr. Bahel’s personal
involvement in ensuring that the vendor, Thunderbird, received advanced
notice of the likely award. Other than the HCC secretary, Mr. Bahel is also
the only individual associated with the request for expedited approval in a
position to seek it. The need for expedited approval for Thunderbird in the
first instance and the effort to notify Thunderbird quickly of a likely award is
questionable in light of the fact that in the same HCC meeting the current
vendor, IECS, was granted an extension to continue for an additional two
months, and that Thunderbird had failed to submit audited financial
statements and was given an additional four weeks to accomplish the task.
(However, Thunderbird took over eight weeks to file the forms). Thus, the
basis for the intensive effort by Mr. Bahel to notify Thunderbird is
problematic, especially in light of the fact that Thunderbird’s application
was still not yet complete. Curiously, there is no request for advanced
notification to IECS of the expedited approval of their extension.
While the minutes of the HCC meeting were pending and not yet
finalized, however, a one page form had been issued by the HCC granting
expedited approval for both the continuation of the current contractor, and
for the replacement, Thunderbird. The circumstances surrounding the
creation of this form and the request for expedited approval in the first
instance are troubling, and are a continued subject of the Task Force’s
investigation. However, at present, there is no evidence in the possession of
4OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE

the Task Force which demonstrates Mr. Cabrera participated in this aspect of
the matter.
After the HCC presentation, Mr. Bahel, who was scheduled to leave
New York for annual leave, convened a meeting with Ms. Jane Redfern, a
UN procurement officer, and Mr. Walter Cabrera prior to his departure. In
this meeting, Mr. Bahel instructed them to notify Thunderbird of the
recommendation to award the contract to them. According to Mr. Cabrera,
he understood that he was not able to provide a Letter of Intent (LOI) to
Thunderbird, but was able to give verbal notification of the HCC’s action
based upon the document issued by the HCC. Mr. Cabrera’s understanding
that this action was permissible was based upon the fact that his supervisor,
Mr. Bahel, directed him to do it, as well as his independent understanding at
the time. At the direction of Mr. Bahel, Mr. Cabrera did in fact notify Mr.
Nishan Kohli that the HCC had recommended that the contract be awarded
to Thunderbird and that Thunderbird would likely receive the contract. Mr.
Cabrera asserts that he further notified Mr. Kohli that PD could not issue an
LOI prior to receiving the approved HCC minutes and formal award of the
contract. (Mr. Kohli’s explanation of the events in his written submission to
the Organization through his attorney materially differs, however the Task
Force does not find Mr. Kohli’s representations credible).
Mr. Cabrera concedes that he provided notice to Nishan Kohli at the
express direction of Mr. Bahel after the HCC had issued a notice of
expedited approval. According to Mr. Cabrera, Mr. Bahel left instructions
to await a copy of the approval in his inbox in the procurement office.
Further, according to Mr. Cabrera, Mr. Bahel explained to Mr. Cabrera that
he would be out of the office and requested that Mr. Cabrera should retrieve
the document and notify the vendor of the likely award. Mr. Cabrera
acknowledges that he followed the direction, and in the course of contact
with Mr. Kohli, he provided the notification.
While the salient facts as they relate to Mr. Cabrera set forth above are
not in dispute, the propriety of his actions has been questioned. The Task
Force has examined whether Mr. Cabrera’s conduct ran afoul of any relevant
United Nations regulations or rules, particularly the prohibition against
improper communication of propriety information to those outside of the
Organization not authorized to receive it (Regulation 1.2(i)), the prohibitions
5OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE
REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
against favoring particular vendors in bidding exercises, and the
procurement rules in general. Mr. Cabrera’s contention in defense of his
actions is that in instances in which the HCC grants expedited approval, and
thereafter issues the approval form, notification to the vendor that an award
is likely does not contravene existing rules.
The Task Force has not been able to identify any precise
procurement rule on this point in existence at this time and requests of
numerous departments in the Organization have failed to produce anything
relevant. Hence, there does not seem to be any clear directive either
permitting or prohibiting such action. Further, several witnesses within the
Organization with significant experience in procurement matters have
informed the Task Force that in circumstances in which expedited approval
is sought, it is not improper to provide such conditional notice to allow a
contractor to prepare to comply with its obligations under the contract and
allow them to adequately prepare themselves to perform in a timely fashion.
While it is certainly questionable whether in this instance notice of expedited
approval was truly exigent in light of the fact that the vendor was not going
to perform under the contract for two months and Thunderbird had yet to
submit audited financial statements, there is no evidence that suggests Mr.
Cabrera shared responsibility for the request in the first instance, or was
otherwise aware of the unexplained circumstances of the request for
expedited approval and the basis for it.
Therefore, in light of the foregoing, and the absence of a clear
regulation to the contrary demonstrating that Mr. Cabrera should have
known his actions were improper, the notification Mr. Cabrera provided
cannot form the basis of an adverse finding against him.
The TCIL Contracts
The contracts awarded to the firm Telecommunication Consultants of
India (TCIL) have been the subject of extensive examination by the Task
Force. Again, while these matters will be discussed in much more
exhaustive and comprehensive detail in a subsequent report, they are
addressed herein only as they relate to Mr. Cabrera.
6OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE
REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The Task Force has examined the five contracts set forth in Table 11
of the audit report AP2005/600/20 of January 19, 2006, at paragraph 123.
While the Task Force acknowledges that the auditors quite correctly found
that strong indications of fraud existed in connection with these contracts, an
examination of Mr. Cabrera’s role in these matters has not resulted in
evidence of improper conduct on his part. The investigation has found that
Mr. Cabrera was not involved in the bidding procedures in these matters,
with the exception of one contract. While an extensive discussion of all of
these cases is therefore unnecessary, an analysis of Case #5, PD/155/02, the
laptop computers, requires discussion as Mr. Cabrera was the case officer.
In this matter, the audit report found at paragraph 125 that “[t]here
were indications that Walter Cabrera distorted communication to DPKO for
the purpose of canceling the initial bid where TCIL was not the lowest
bidder, and the Compaq brand of computers offered by TCIL was not going
to be selected as a standardized brand. TCIL won the replacement bid.”
In addressing this issue, some background is necessary. First, it
should be noted that the procurement file in this matter was found to be
incomplete, missing documents and relevant information. The Task Force
was able to identify more details as a result of forensic analysis of electronic
media. However, it cannot be said that the Task Force is comfortable that all
information involving this matter has been gathered. That said, the Task
Force was able to reconstruct the following facts concerning this matter from
various documents and searches of electronic media, and discussions with
relevant parties.
In February, 2002, DPKO Communications and Technology Services
Division (CITS) sought to obtain a new systems contract for laptop
computers. Mr. Cabrera was the procurement officer in the procurement
department (PD) assigned to this matter. The Chief of CITS communicated
his request to PD, and on February 25, 2002 an expression of interest was
issued by PD. An invitation to bid followed on April 15, 2002 which was
transmitted to 36 vendors from nine countries.
CITS advised PD that they desired only “IBM, Dell and Compaq”
based on ITSD standards for desktop computers. On the other hand, PD and
the Information Technology Services Division (ITSD), involved in the
7OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE
REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
process by Mr. Bahel, recommended adding Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu and
NEC to the list. In a subsequent exchange of emails between PD and the
requisitioner (CITS and ITSD), CITS continued to assert that they sought
only the three major brands of computers to avoid “inferior products,”
laptops from “questionable manufacturers,” “clones” and “home built
computers.” Ultimately, however, CITS agreed that they were amenable to
expanding the field to include other major brands of computer manufacturers
who were recognized industry leaders. As a result, on April 24, 2002, the
case officer, Mr. Cabrera, issued a bid amendment notification to the
vendors correcting the anticipated quantity of the computers sought, and
clarifying that that only “Compaq, Dell, IBM, Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu and
NEC” brands would be considered for solicitation.
On May 15, 2002 the bids were read publicly. La Cresta
Communications of California submitted the lowest priced bid based upon a
Pentium III Toshiba model. TCIL was the next lowest bidder offering a
Compaq model, followed by Dell, and then SSDI with an IBM, and finally
Manchester Technologies offering a Fujitsu model. On May 30, 2002, Mr.
Cabrera notified La Cresta that the company needed to resubmit the
specifications for the Toshiba model they were offering as the table of
compliance with the bid technical terms was absent and specification pages
from La Cresta’s submission were contrary to the proper format.
Nevertheless, Mr. Cabrera allowed La Cresta to resubmit the pages.
In its response, La Cresta informed PD that Toshiba was
discontinuing the Pentium III model offered in its original submission, but
that they would upgrade the model proposed to a Pentium IV at no extra cost
to the Organization. La Cresta informed PD that because Toshiba was
discontinuing the Pentium III model, they therefore could not provide the
anticipated quantity of Pentium III laptops called for in the RFP. However,
La Cresta informed PD of its ability to fill the order for the guaranteed
quantity with the currently proposed model and of its readiness to fill the
remainder with an upgraded model at no extra cost.
The investigation has revealed that Mr. Cabrera forwarded to CITS,
by email, La Cresta’s updated offer of an upgraded model. Email
communication reflects that Mr. Cabrera’s dialogue with DPKO continued
with respect to La Cresta’s offer. The Task Force has expended
8OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE
REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
considerable effort to reconstruct the sequence of events that followed. A
three week lapse existed between the time of the finding that La Cresta was
determined to be compliant, and the initiation of the re-bidding exercise. In
the interim period, email correspondence confirms that DPKO found
LaCresta to be technically compliant even after the offer of an upgrade. Mr.
Cabrera was further in the midst of preparing the presentation to the HCC.
Procurement Department officials concede that at this point there
was no further issue and there was no justification not to award the contract
to LaCresta. Indeed, no justification is provided to La Cresta, or found in
the file. It seems that La Cresta was not formally informed of the
cancellation. (Typically the case officer maintains the responsibility for
communicating the cancellation to the vendor.) In this case, there is no
correspondence in the case file from procurement to the vendor notifying
them of the cancellation. A DPKO official involved in the process has
informed the Task Force that in conversations with PD in this interim period,
it was represented to him that PD had expressed a view that there was an
“issue” with LaCresta’s submission. According to the official, the
Procurement Department suggested a re-bid because of a “technicality.”
While the official objected, he was told that because the matter is a
commercial one it is only within PD’s prerogative to cancel the bid on the
basis of commercial non-compliance. This explanation is not persuasive as
there was no commercial or technical issue with LaCresta’s bid. DPKO had
found La Cresta to be compliant and the firm was the lowest bidder. Mr.
Cabrera agrees that the reasoning proffered by PD to the DPKO official is
not sound, but takes issue with any claim participation by him in the
exchange or decision.
Nonetheless, it is clear that a new invitation to bid (ITB) was
issued. The basis for this renewed ITB however is not clear, nor is the
identity of the individual(s) who sought it. The Task Force has not
identified any evidence to support a finding that Mr. Cabrera was involved
in the decision and the documents demonstrate that Mr. Cabrera continued to
maintain a dialogue with DPKO concerning its requests. Further, the Task
Force has not identified evidence which suggests Mr. Cabrera sought to
cancel the bid, and then seek a re-bidding exercise.
9OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE
REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The investigation has revealed however that Mr. Cabrera’s supervisor,
Sanjaya Bahel, was intimately involved in the matter, and interjected himself
in it, communicating with ITSD officials and DPKO officials. The DPKO
official referred to above stated that he had conversations with Mr. Bahel in
which Mr. Bahel confirmed that PD was of the view that there was a
technical issue with LaCresta’s bid, and there should be a new bidding
exercise.
The proposal was re-bid in early July. The supplemental ITB
ultimately limited the solicitation to the three brands requested by CITS.
The ITB was based upon the upgraded specifications, the Pentium IV model.
Ten companies responded, and two companies, TCIL and Danoffice, were
the most competitive both offering the same Compaq model. TCIL offered
the lowest price, followed by Danoffice. Of the initial bidders, TCIL was
the only company to offer a lower price for the computer model it offered.
All other vendors raised their prices from the initial bid. Although La Cresta
offered a Compaq brand, and the second lowest bid, the model it was
offering was inferior to the models offered by TCIL and Danoffice, and was
in fact determined by CITS to be non-compliant.
On July 18, 2002, Sanjaya Bahel, the Officer in Charge of
Procurement at the time, recommended the award to TCIL for a systems
contract in the amount of US$5,340,000. In the presentation of the matter to
the HCC, officials questioned the basis for limiting the bidding exercise to
the three specified brands and intimated that the PD violated UN rules and
regulations by the use of brand names in its ITB. Email communication after
the event describes a circumstance in which DPKO officials are questioned
about the limitation of the re-solicitation to the three preferred brands. The
HCC stated that “were it not for the imminent loss of funds, the Committee
would have recommended that a re-bidding exercise be conducted inviting
all brands of laptops that met the UN’s requirement.” Nevertheless, the
proposed contract award to TCIL was ultimately approved, and signed.
The cancellation of the first bid, and the invitation for vendors to
re-submit further bids in light of the cancellation, allowed the other vendors
a second opportunity to bid on the laptop contract. While it is unclear what
precipitated this action, the re-bidding exercise is questionable in light of the
fact that LaCresta was held to be technically compliant and offered the
10OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE
REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA

lowest bid. On that basis, it appears that they should have been awarded the
contract in the absence of objection by the requisitioner. Mr. Cabrera
concedes that this is the case. Nevertheless, there is a lack of evidence in
possession of the Task Force that Mr. Cabrera was a factor in causing the re-
bidding exercise. Indeed, he did not have the authority to do it, and past
practice suggests that such a decision could only come from a supervisor.
As such, the Task Force’s investigation cannot conclude that Mr. Cabrera
engaged in this act to favor TCIL, notwithstanding the fact that cancellation
of the initial bid and the re-bidding exercise allowed TCIL, and the other
vendors, a second opportunity for the contract.
CONCLUSION
Based upon the foregoing, the Task Force’s investigation has been
unable to identify a sufficient basis to support a finding that procurement
officer Walter Cabrera acted in violation UN rules and regulations of the
Organization in connection with 1) his involvement in the Thunderbird
matter in 2002, and 2) his participation in the TCIL contracts, and in
particular the laptop contract, which were the subject of the audit report.

Description
Top Secret US National Security Agency report on highlights from signals intelligence intercepts of high-
level French government communications. The extract dating from March 24, 2010 summarises
communications between the French Ambassador in Washington D.C. Pierre Vimont, and French
President Nicolas Sarkozy's diplomatic advisor Jean-David Levitte. The report reveals various potential
topics Sarkozy intended to raise with US President Barack Obama during an upcoming meeting in
Washington. Topping Sarkozy's agenda is his frustration that the US has backed away from a bilaterial
intelligence cooperation agreement which might restrict the US ability to continue spying on France.
Other issues include the potential French commitment of military trainers to Afghanistan, a potential
European Aeronautic Defence and Space Corporation (EADS) contract for tanker aircraft with the US
military, and a trademark dispute concerning the French spirits company Pernod Ricard.Sensitive Issues on the Agenda When French, U.S. Presidents Meet Next
Week in Washington (TS//SI//NF)
(TS//SI//NF) French President Sarkozy intends to raise a number of
sensitive topics with the U.S. President when the two leaders meet in
Washington on 31 March, according to an exchange last week between
the French ambassador in Washington Pierre Vimont, and Sarkozy's
diplomatic advisor, Jean­David Levitte. Vimont conveyed that the
French President will express his frustration that Washington has
backed away from its proposed bilateral intelligence cooperation
agreement and Sarkozy intends to continue to push for closure. As
Vimont and Levitte understand it, the main sticking point is the U.S.
desire to continue spying on France. On the topic of Afghanistan,
Levitte noted that Sarkozy is ready to authorize more military
trainers but wants clarification on how many are needed, given the
conflicting figures from U.S. sources. Another proposed topic was
efforts by the European Aeronautic, Defense, and Space Corporation
(EADS) to win a tanker aircraft contract with the U.S. military.
Vimont revealed cryptically that the deal is moving forward but did
not provide any details. Levitte had not expected to put the labeling
dispute with Pernod Ricard (the world's second largest spirits group)
on the agenda, but Sarkozy had just spoken to the company's chairman
who had asked the president to intercede on his behalf. (COMMENT:
Patrick Ricard, chairman of the Pernod Ricard board of directors, is
said to be one of Sarkozy's wealthy backers.) Vimont characterized
the issue as a very political matter in the U.S., and suggested that
a direct appeal to the White House might be useful. While Sarkozy
intends to broach the issue with the U.S. President, Levitte will
talk to the U.S. President's Economic Adviser and Deputy National
Security Adviser. Finally, Levitte expected the two leaders to
discuss other pressing subjects including Iran, the Middle East Peace
Process, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, the Sahel, Russia,
China, Turkey, climate change, and the financial situation of several
European countries; however, he provided no details on those topics.

Investigation Task Force
Irregularities in the addition of a single source contract one month after the
award of a contract for the supply of two new containers and the dismantling,
transport and re-construction of a further seven containers at Pristina Airport
(Case 0281/04)
I. INTRODUCTION
1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28 February 2003 into the financial
statements of Pristina International Airport conducted by the Chartered
Accountants which led to an investigation concerning alleged corruption and
irregularities arising in the course of procurements and contracts at Pristina
International Airport.
2. It is alleged that a single source contract for one container was added one month
after a main contract for the supply of two new containers and the dismantling,
transport and re-construction of a further seven containers at Pristina Airport.
II. METHODOLOGY
3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on
the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators
conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons
indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by
obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV,
which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.
III. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
4. Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under
Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal
buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period
covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the
Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the
Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution
1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999.
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned
and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.
5. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed
from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The KTA Divisional
Manager was appointed to the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under him2
were the PEAP Official and the ACTS Official.
6. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been
under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under
ICAO regulations.
7. It is against this background of change that procurement procedures relating to
the following contract have been examined.
IV. INVESTIGATION DETAILS
8. This investigation relates to a Contract, for the supply of two new containers and
the dismantling, transport and re- construction of a further seven containers at
Pristina Airport. It also deals with a further single source contract for the supply of
a further container. The value of the contract is €24,762 and the supplementary
contract €4,100.
9. It is alleged that there were irregularities in the addition of a single source
contract one month after the award of the main contract. In addition, there did not
appear to be any capital expenditure approval or payment order on file.
10. Evidence contained in a bid evaluation report dated 29 August 2002 indicates
that a competitive tender was held on 29 August 2002 for the supply of two new
containers and the dismantling, transport and re-construction of a further seven
containers at Pristina Airport.
11. Following a competitive tender, the contract was awarded to the Vendor who
submitted the lowest bid in the sum of €24,762. A contract was signed with the
company on 29 August 2002.
12. On 4 September 2002, a further single source contract was signed by the KTA
Divisional Manager for the supply of an additional container. This appears to
have resulted from a direct request from KFOR signed by the KFOR Official of Air
Movements, dated 3 September 2002, which is attached to the justification for the
single source contract.
13. The tender file does not contain either a justification memorandum or financial
approval documents for the main contract and those documents have not been
locate by the ITF.
V. CONCLUSIONS
14. A competitive tender appears to have been correctly held for the main contract
and the addition of the single source contract to add a further container appears
to be justified. However, there is an absence of proper records detailing events
that gave rise to the competitive tender, together with an absence of documents
confirming that financial approval was sought.
15. Both the contracts and the justification for the single source contract appear to
have been signed by the KTA Divisional Manager.3
16. In the absence of further documents it is not possible to indicate whether or not
there were irregularities in the financial approval procedure.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
17. It is recommended that UNMIK refer this matter to the D/SRSG of Pillar IV for any
action deemed appropriate with regard to the management of contract files.

Description
Interception of French Ambassador in Washington Jean-David Levitte reveals his frustration towards a
report from Iraq Survey Group and its finding that the UN Oil-for-food program was possibly misused by
French companies. In the interception Levitte states that it is scandalous that no U.S. companies are
named in the report and claimed that many French companies named were actually subsidiaries of U.S.
firms. He planned to present the list of these companies to both the U.S. Congress and the media.(TS//SI) French Envoy Plans to Release List of U.S. Firms Who
Allegedly Profited From OFF
(TS//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR and NZL) French Ambassador Jean­
David Levitte in Washington plans to respond as early as today to
information in the Iraq Survey Group report regarding possible misuse
of the UN Oil­for­Food (OFF) program by companies from France and
other countries during the former Iraqi regime. The ambassador termed
the report scandalous, since it named no U.S. companies and he
claimed that many French companies with contracts under the OFF
program were actually subsidiaries of U.S. firms that also profited
from the business dealings. He therefore planned, with foreign
ministry backing, to present a list of these U.S. companies to both
the U.S. Congress and the media.
